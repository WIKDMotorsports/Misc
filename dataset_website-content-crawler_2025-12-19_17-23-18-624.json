Over time as competition with larger OTA’s grew in this space, Fareconnect expanded into brick-and-mortar stores adding Home -Based Agents who were associated with the brick-and-mortar locations. In 2014, Fareconnect decided to restructure the company and move to a more centralized organization to support and recruit independent contractors. In 2015, Fareconnect reduced its number of stores to two locations in Medicine Hat Alberta and Winnipeg Manitoba. These stores restructured to add training and support of all IC’s, as the company transitioned to a fully functionable Host Agency.

We are proud to say that we have overcome some of the most turbulent times in the travel industry and not just survived, but grown. During the economic recession in 2009, many travel agencies \"closed their doors\" whereas we grew from a 2-agent organization to roughly having over 300 home based travel agents associated with us since January 2010. We also increased our staff from two to nine. The proof of our success stems from the dedication of our team and all our home based travel agents. Our gross sales have increased by over 500% in most areas. We give our home based travel agents priority on all educational and ‘FAM’ trips because we feel that the more educated they are, the easier and more effective they will be at selling.\nUpcoming Events"

  "text": "Incentive Connection Travel | Host Agency Reviews\nWhen choosing a Host Agency, look for one that:\nIs large enough to give you the benefits of strong industry ties and support, but not so large that you get lost in numbers.\nWill not attempt to steal your clients\nIs financially stable\nHas been in business a long time and pays commissions on time, every time\nAsk if you are allowed to work directly with supplier BDMs. Are you isolated and/or limited to the questions you can ask a supplier?\nIs there co-op money you can tap to help you with your marketing programs?\nAre you continually made aware of industry happenings, promotions and events, or are you on your own to get this information?\nAnd, most importantly, cares about you and your success\nSupport When You Need It\nIn these less than optimal times, agents need strong support. Through our close supplier relationships, Orbitz, Travelocity and Expedia are no longer impediments to closing the deal. Our agents can offer the same prices with a smile, and the personal service the Internet agencies do not.\nSince we have no retail trade, our business model is 100% based on agent support with the philosophy that if the agent does not succeed, neither do we.\nBeing part of a mega franchise company might sound intriguing, but they are highly regulated and limit what you can and cannot do within your own business. You are an Independent Contractor, and as such, are governed by the IRS rules for ICs. You are entitled to run your business in any way you choose (within the guidelines of the industry and good business practices), build your business to the max and should you decide to leave, your clients go with you..not stay as a house account of your former Host Agency.\nTravel Leaders Network\nTravel Leaders is one of the world’s most respected consortia. TLN membership offers greater discounts, programs, higher commissions due to the volume it gives its preferred suppliers. Some of the TLN Programs we offer at no cost to all our agents are: the Hotel and Cruise Amenities programs, where you can offer amenities for hotel bookings and group rates on a one cabin sale, convenience of a Host on board, complimentary private cocktail party, bottle of wine, free Shore Excursion(s), robe or other pillow gifts…all in your name as your clients agent and at no cost to you"

Prior to joining Global Travelers I felt like I was just flapping in the wind with no real direction or help. I felt like just another number. I wasn't making any money but I didn't want to quit because I am passionate about this business. Enter Global Travelers....I immediately felt a connection with the owner just from the way she presented herself. This agency has more of a family vibe because the people at the top don't just look out for themselves. Everybody can grow together and no one minds sharing their knowledge. The training you get....invaluable. You can see the passion from them and it makes you want to work just a little bit harder. I can say that since joining this agency my sales have definitely increased and it's only looking up. If you are looking for an agency that will help you succeed....come on to Global Travelers & Company!!\nAndrea Bledsoe\nJoining Global Travelers & Company has been the best decision I've ever made for my travel business. The resources and the training provided have been invaluable. There has never been a time I wasn't able to receive assistance from the anyone in the group. There is never any competition with teammates. We hold each other accountable for getting the work done. When one of us wins, we all win. I was never able to get this type of support from my previous host agency.\n0\n1\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSince joining in June 2019, GlobalTravels & Company has been a wealth of information in starting a Travel Business. From the simple less thing from starting your website, to organization of group travel. We have a great team that each individual has their own talent in working as a team in becoming travel professionals. To yearly FAMS to webinars with BDM's. I highly recommend GT&C.\n0\n1\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI joined the agency January 2020, it was important to be apart of a brand that encourages and promotes providing my clients more than the book and go concept. To have a leader who understands the transition from coming from the mlm model to wanting to really becoming an agent is essential. I have grown and now I've found my niche and working in that field confidently. \n0\n1\nDid you find this review helpful?\nMaking the transition to Global Travelers was the best thing that I could have done for my business.

Did you?\nI joined Global Travelers because the owner, Leggra, has a plethora of knowledge when it comes to being a travel agent. After taking one of her groups class, I realized my current host was not going to help me grow in the way that I needed to become a full time travel agent. Since being with Global Travelers, my knowledge base has expanded along with my self confidence as a travel advisor. You are supposed to surround yourself with like minded individuals who will push you to keep going, and during the pandemic she did just that. Forever grateful to be part of such a team. \n0\n1\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

  "text": "Gateway Travel Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nHey Richard\nThank you so much for taking the time to share your detailed feedback. We truly value the experiences and insights of our community members, as they help us grow and improve.\nWe're delighted to hear that you appreciated our extensive list of suppliers and found our support staff helpful. Providing a robust network and dedicated support is something we pride ourselves on, and it's wonderful to know that these aspects have positively impacted your experience.\nRegarding our supplier selection, we restrict suppliers based on previous predatory experiences. Part of our responsibility is to thoroughly vet our suppliers to ensure that our agents are protected and can operate in a secure and supportive environment. (Basically we make sure they pay you).\nWe're also excited about our Social Media Spark program, which is designed to ignite creativity among our agents. This program has helped many of our agents make hundreds of additional bookings in its first year and I'm sorry that wasn't your experience. Additionally, we recently launched over 500 creative Canva templates available for our agents to use for free—did you have a chance to check those out?\nIn terms of training, we've significantly expanded our offerings. We now have 20 different training courses with over 500 classes, including weekly live sessions and direct supplier training. Have you had the opportunity to explore these resources? We believe they provide valuable, tailored support for both new and experienced agents.\nWe understand your concerns about our CRM system. We launched the new Portal on January first, and all existing agents are in the process of transferring over next month. Unfortunately, when working with advanced technology and AI, some delays can occur.\nTo ensure a smooth transition for our existing agents, we have a thorough onboarding process designed to place them in the perfect spot for their production level. This includes group Zoom support with our staff and a unique, new group each quarter depending on growth and experience.\nFor our new agents, we offer live group sessions every week along with 1-1 support calls available anytime you want to schedule them. Our live new agent group sessions are tailored to provide the guidance and support needed to kickstart your journey with Gateway Travel.\nAt Gateway Travel, our mission is to support our agents in every possible way, and your success is our success. We are continuously working to enhance our services and resources to better serve our community. We would love the opportunity to discuss your experience further and explore how we can better support you moving forward. Please feel free to reach out to your agency contact directly.\nFor others reading this review, if you're interested in learning more about what Gateway Travel has to offer, please email us at newagentsupport@gatewaytravel.com to set up a \"learn about\" call. Additionally, you can stay connected and get the latest updates by joining us live on Facebook and YouTube twice a week.\nThank you again for your constructive feedback and for being a valued member of the Gateway Travel community. We're committed to making positive changes and hope to exceed your expectations in the future.\nWarm regards,\nJosh"

My favorite trip with the agency was Europe where I visited Athens, Santorini, and Mykonos. The trip planning was seamless and we had an escorted tour from the time we arrived in the city. The agency offers group trips every year. We also participate in Fam trip to become familiar with a place in order to provide first hand knowledge to our clients.

The support, resources, and community they offer have empowered me to deliver outstanding service to my clients and build a sustainable, rewarding career from home. \nChoosing the right host agency is one of the most important decisions you can make for your business. The president of the company Jill La Barre, is a leader who truly cares about her members, because of that you always feel supported. With Travel Agent Pro, you can be confident that you are making a choice that will set you up for long-term growth, satisfaction, and success. (And the commission program is excellent.) \nJoe Porpiglia\nWe were looking for a host agency that would provide us with a blend of strong relationships with industry partners, an attractive commission split and excellent opportunities for professional development. We also wanted to know that we have support when needed. When we found Travel Agent Pro we knew this was the host agency for us. TAP consistently provides all of the above and so much more. It's great to be with such a strong network of like-minded travel professionals, both seasoned and new to the industry. All this is due to strong leadership and empowerment. Thanks, Jill!\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nHi Linda, we are so happy to have you as a member of Travel Agent Pro. We are here to help grow and support your business. You are off to an amazing start, and we are grateful for the opportunity to work with you. \nI just recently joined Travel Agent Pro and I couldn't be happier. The beautiful thing about this host agency is that it was created by travel advisors for travel advisors. The President is very involved and supportive, as is the entire TAP community. There are tons of resources on our intranet. I feel very seen and important at this boutique agency and for that reason, it is second to none. Whether you are new to the industry or a seasoned agent, there is a home here for you. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nTina, Thank you so much for your beautiful sentiment.

We were thrilled you could join us at The Retreat and happy to know you found it rewarding. We are so glad you and your team joined Travel Agent Pro. We know you will continue to grow and look forward to years of supporting you and your business needs. \nJenn Mlynarek\nI recently switched hosts to join Travel Agent Pro, and I couldn’t be happier with the decision. The president has years of experience as an advisor, and she’s incredible at helping with exactly what’s needed and showing how to get there. The commission structure is Great, but it’s the support that makes TAP truly special. The community of advisors is amazing—everyone is willing to jump in and answer questions at any time, which makes such a difference. We just went on our first retreat in St. Lucia, and it was the perfect mix of learning, connecting, and fun. Being part of Signature Travel is an added bonus. I’m so glad I made the move—it’s been the perfect fit. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nThank you for your kind words Jenn. We are so happy to have you as a member of TAP.

We love having you in our community and are grateful you chose us to support your business. \nAs a newer travel advisor, I have found the support of Travel Agent Pro invaluable. President Jill La Barre has created a special company where I can thrive and grow my business. The back office support team is very helpful and makes sure we are always informed of the latest promotions and opportunities with suppliers.

We are grateful to have you with us. \nSarah Kinard\nAs a newer, part-time, travel agent, the hands-on approach that president, Jill LaBarre, takes in setting the agents up for success is refreshing. Our previous host agency dropped you in the deep end and hoped you could succeed on your own. TAP is accessible for questions, takes agent feedback into consideration when building tools and partnerships, and the community is generous with support and information. \nTAP is collaborative, supportive, and engaging as a host agency.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSarah, thank you for sharing this lovely assessment.

They are all knowledgeable agents who offer help whenever needed. I am lucky that I am in Myrtle Beach so that I can stop in and meet the girls in person to pick up mail or brochures.

  "text": "1000 Mile Travel Group Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nFinding a host was very difficult. This comprehensive review site helped me a lot while doing research. I have never been a travel agent so lacking experience in this field, it was confusing to find the right agency. I finally chose Montrose because of the booking engine with really competitive prices located on the Website. I've only been here a month, but the training (free) is good, and the marketing program (free) seems to be superior. I like the fact that there are no additional fees for Website or marketing. Whenever I call in, the support team is great and helpful. I've only scratched the surface but I feel I made the right decision.\nMargie\nI have been with MTravel for six years. I recently had an issue with a tour operator that did not provide the service my client paid for. I went around and around with these people and was getting no where. I called in to our client value managers - Daena and Debbie to seek guidance on what to do next. They got the details of what happened and took over from there. I am happy to report they not only got back the partial refund I requested, they got my client a full refund, making me look like a rockstar!! I am so thankful for the opportunity to work through MTravel and the support I have received over the years. \n5\n0\n5 people found this review helpful.

What I like best is that they have a listening ear. They really care about us and our goals for our businesses. They hear us when we ask! Recently, we have had a major upgrade to our technology that was very much needed. With all things new, we've encountered some challenges. However, I am happy to say that the new technology is working well for my business and all the glitches are being handled in a timely manner. This new technology and all of the supportive services, and the training offered has motivated me and allowed me to grow my business. I really appreciate the support that I receive from the IC support team and my Client Value Manager. \nI recently did the numbers and my business has grown 57% since last year this time. That is incredible growth! I must say that the growth is a direct result of the ideas, training, support that I receive from MTravel hosting services. It's my business and I am allowed to run it my way, but I never feel alone, I never feel that I don't have resources to assist me to get where I want to go. MTravel hosting is a wonderful partner and I my business has flourished with their care, assistance, and support. \nI highly recommend them as a host agency who listens and understand the needs of independent travel advisor who want to be successful! \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nHi Gwiin,\nThank you for your kind and candid feedback about your experience with MTravel. It is a joy to hear of your positive experiences with our service teams and new technology platform. Congratulations on your phenomenal business growth this year!

All of us at MTravel look forward to helping you grow your brand and increase your business long into the future.

We chose MTravel based on the glowing reviews here and after spending hours looking at various host options and what each had to offer in the way of support , training, technology, resources and access. The exposure so far to suppliers and training are what we had hoped for. The new technology roll out shows lots of promise and a solid vision for future development and was a much needed update. \nSome of that roll out felt a bit rushed- taking sites down during business hours was a bit rough, occasional hiccups in data results/presentation and the way information has or has not been sorted in the new agent portal. I know it will get fixed- so I'm being patient. \nPerhaps it is growing pains/challenges with the CTM merger, but I would say as well, the inconsistencies in responding to support requests/ emails is probably my one issue to date. Often more than a couple days to hear back from someone. It is acknowledged, when joining MTravel that they take a bigger commission split for new agents because they anticipate doing more hand holding. However when you can't get responses in a timely manner or help is only available M-F business hours, I'm not sure what extra hand holding I am getting for the higher split. \nWe believe MTravel has a solid foundation. Hoping they are able to resolve the technology and communication challenges going forward. Staying hopeful and patient.\n12\n1\n12 people found this review helpful.

We do wish your entire experience had been exceptional, as we aim for every customer, and will take your valuable feedback to incorporate into our service delivery standards.

I was excited to join MTravel, but wound up disappointed. The training was essentially just people droning over PowerPoints. (You also have an in-person option for these instead.) I had one call with the person that was supposed to be my mentor and thereafter I sent some emails. But, she was usually traveling and not available. She was very nice, but not really any help. Instead, I was directed to the support people who didn’t really seem thrilled to be answering my newbie questions. Support was not great - esp. since they would be getting 50% of my commissions. I expected more. As other reviewers have mentioned, their systems were quite old looking. I haven’t used the new system as I have stopped using them. But, Was able to log in to look around as of 2 weeks ago and it’s still very basic looking. After a short time with my new host agency I can say the difference is night and day. I would not recommend this agency for travel newbies. \n14\n2\n14 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWe are sorry to hear that your initial experience joining MTravel was less than impeccable. We strive to provide strong support and learning opportunities for new industry entrants, including virtual and in-person training sessions, one-on-one mentoring, day-to-day support, and annual events that help you network among your travel peers. Your choice of MTravel as we launch major technology releases gives you a first look at our latest tools that support your needs as you grow your new business. As with most technology roll outs, our latest products are being introduced in phases so agents will experience rapid development of new features based on direct feedback loops. The anonymous nature of your feedback makes it difficult for us to respond in detail to your experience. Should you choose to engage us directly, we are always available and open to hear your input. We value your first-hand feedback that allows us to continually improve the experience of new travel professionals! You may contact either myself or our Senior Vice President, Salv Silvera, at 800-870-5799 or via email at melissa.roberts@mtravel.com or salv.silvera@travelctm.com to share your MTravel experience.\nWe have been with Montrose for a long time, and things have really gone downhill. A new system has been in the works for a year, so the old system was neglected. Unfortunately, the new system that was recently launched is a disaster and support has been minimal. I agree with the other reviewer who stated that the support staff often seems irritated by questions (if they get around to answering your question at all). As a result, our ability to provide exceptional service to our clients is suffering.

As with most technology roll outs, we are releasing our latest products in phases so you will experience rapid development of new features based on direct user feedback. We continually refine our launch and communication processes and we appreciate your input as it allows us to improve! If you were unable to attend our town hall meeting and training session last week, we invite you to join the additional training sessions we are having to ensure you understand the latest features and benefits of the MTravel technology suite and can provide immediate feedback on the new tools we’ve made available to you. We answer all support requests in the order they are received, and if you need urgent assistance, you may always call us directly at our support desk. You may also contact either myself or our Senior Vice President, Salv Silvera, at 800-870-5799 or via email at melissa.roberts@mtravel.com or salv.silvera@travelctm.com and we are happy to respond, in detail, to any issues or concerns you may have.\nMelissa Roberts \nBusiness Development Manager\nI haven't been in the travel business for long but have many years of experience in business management and operations. I know inefficient when I see it. MTravel leaves much to be desired. The company's current website for agents and training on how to conduct business with the company are very outdated. They are doing no updates or maintenance because they are working on a new site they have promised to release for the past year. They are inconsistent in communicating with independent contractors. Sometimes they seem annoyed when you ask a question because of some inconsistency or outdated information on their website It is really disappointing right now. I am currently with them but if I were new I would refrain from considering them as a host agency until they up their game. The terms and conditions of affiliating with them are attractive but that needs to be weighed against the current state of their operations.\n8\n0\n8 people found this review helpful.

Lost $1000 in commission for one piece of paper\n5\n0\n5 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nDear Bob, \nI am sorry to hear about negative experience with our host agency. I double checked with our team to get a little background on what happened to see if anything can be done. From my understanding, there was an issue with your groups being booked with non-preferred suppliers. When the booking was submitted, it was submitted as “Misc Tour” which defaults to non-preferred status in our system. According to our contract, all bookings made with a non-preferred supplier will be subject to a reduction in the regular commission split by 10% (example: 70/30 split will be paid at 60/40 split). We do offer a non-preferred supplier exemption request form that if filled out and approved at the time of booking, the agent will get paid at their regular commission split. Unfortunately, in your case, the form was not filled out for any of the groups that you have had with us over the years. This policy at has been in place since 2015 and we were not able to make an exception. Our team did offer to make sure to assist you on future groups so this does not happen again, but you decided to decline the offer and leave our agency. We do wish you all the best in your future endeavors. The door is always open if things change in the future. If you do have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me at 800-870-5799 or via email. I am happy to assist in any way I can. \nBest, \nMelissa Roberts \nBusiness Development Manager for MTravel Hosting Services\nI have been with MTravel for almost 5 years. I chose them as a hosting agency because of their reputation in the industry. Montrose Travel is a solvent, family owned company that is deeply invested in their hosting program. Their support agents are awesome and very helpful. They offer unlimited training on our preferred suppliers. I have been in the travel industry over 20 years doing both leisure and corporate travel. When I signed on with MTravel I focused on the leisure side and have since added corporate travel management to my business. I have full support from MTravel and their help has been amazing! They offer the most current technology so we run our businesses smoothly. We have amazing consortium parthers with Ensemble Travel and Radius Travel. MTravel has yearly conferences and the training is phenomenal! We go to different destinations every year so we can see for ourselves what there is to offer. I cannot say enough good things about MTravel. I look forward to many more years of working with them.\n47\n1\n47 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI decided to join Montrose Travel as an agent based on what I had read about the company however, I was not completely sure of what I was getting myself into. After three months as an agent hosted by Montrose Travel, I feel they have exceeded my expectations of quality support, training and service. The staff is friendly and eager to help me succeed. I highly recommend Montrose Travel to anyone interested in becoming a travel professional.\n51\n1\n51 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nSupport..........SUPPORT!

From the moment I joined this dynamic team, I knew I had found a workplace unlike any other. \nFirst and foremost, 1923 Travel fosters a culture of passion and dedication towards travel that is truly contagious. Every day, I am surrounded by colleagues (virtually and locally!) who share my love for exploration and adventure. This shared enthusiasm creates an environment where creativity thrives and everyone shares their niche expertise and skills with the group. \n​ \nOne of the things I love most about working for 1923 Travel is how the agency is managed. Megan, our agency owner, embodies authenticity, intelligence, and an unwavering eagerness to help. Her passion for travel is matched only by her generosity and commitment to supporting her team of agents. 1923 Travel is local to me, so I have had the privilege of getting to know Megan through frequent coffee meetings and attending conventions together. A true sticking point for me was to avoid predatory MLM travel companies; Megan has proven that 1923 Travel will never transition into this type of business structure. She is steadfast in her support and celebration of every one of her agents' independent successes. \n​ \nWorking for 1923 Travel has been a dream come true. I am so grateful for the opportunity to be part of a team that is passionate, innovative, and dedicated to making travel dreams a reality, all while working from home doing something that makes me HAPPY!

Did you?\nTrish DeDamos Just 4U Travel\nMy orginal host agency was purchased by Altour/ The Travel Authority in summer 2010. Any one who has a host knows that when new owners come in things will/may change. At first I thought I would have to switch immediately, fellow hosted agents and myself were assured \"independant agents are important to our growth\" yada yada. Invoicing and getting paid acurately was difficult and still is. The invoice system is long and needs dozens of little tid bits of infor to identify (such BS when you see how other hosts do it.) They seem to misplace commission alot but always paid when you did all the research to find the payment they recieved. Spring of 2012 (about 18 months later) out of the blue hosted agents get a email letter commission across the board will go to 60/40% split. Most of us were at 80/20 or 70/30. I left, unfortunatley 30,000 of commission is still in limbo because I could NOT transfer owner ship to new host Nexion, which is a vendor issue. I was orginally told I could take ALL my bookings. When we figured out that would not be possible (again a vendor/ MLT system issue) thats when real trouble started! Becuase the split was going to be huge (20% less for me) I wrote to the coordinator told Altour I would not be making NEW reservations and here is the list of travelers (MY clients) for the remainder of the year (last group travels Nov 2012) I expect to have access to my log ins and client files until they are done and get paid 80% these where made prior to the announcement. The next month my log in ID was DELETED with MLT.... TOTALLY NOT COOL. They could have put my log in ID on hold (as admin) but decided to delete! Hours to try and fiure out how to correct. The \"work around\" is to make a new log in ID with ad min rights.... meaning I could DELETE thier log in ID's.... I would NOT do that but really people. Stay away! Go with a REALY host agency Nexion and Travel Planners are HOSTs and dont own brick and mortar like Altour and Travel Authority.\n9\n2\n9 people found this review helpful.

This company has been my host agency since 2002. America's Travel Companies Inc. is well respected in the travel industry by it's consortium and has partnership with many travel suppliers. This company maintains registrations in several travel industry associations. As a boutique agency, the staff knows each agent by name and by face! America's Travel Companies Inc. strives to provide its agents with the support and tools needed to help the agents succeed. Whether through annual seminars, regional workshops, webinars, emails or phone calls, this agency shows they care about the development and success of its agents. They offer hours that are convenient to agents across the United States. They engage agents for feedback on ideas to better the agency. Many agents have earned IATAN status and CLIA certifications while being hosted by America's Travel Companies Inc. I wouldn't think of being hosted by anyone else!\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nAmerica's Travel is a great Host Agency to be affiliated with. I have been with America's Travel over 10 years and loved every minute of it. They want every travel agent to succeed in growing their business an is always available to assist you. I reached IATAN with the help of the staff at Americas Travel. They treat you as though you are their only agent and really wants to help you grow your business. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a Host Agency.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nAmerica's Travel Companies is a great hosting company. Although Im new to the travel business, my goal is to learn as much as I can so when I retire, travel will be my next career. \nATC offers a lot of training opportunities which is what a newbie needs getting into the travel industry. \nLifelong friendships have been established and I will forever be grateful to ATC.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI was introduced to America's Travel Companies nearly 8 years ago. Initially I joined simply to arrange travel for my family and I. Life happens, which caused me to step away for a couple of years, however I still continued to maintain my active status. After reinventing myself, I began reading, taking online classes and attending workshops to promote my travel business. America's Travel Companies has been there every step of the way from my entry level days to encourage and help enhance my knowledge. The expertise knowledge, training and personal attention offered is the very best. Through word of mouth and referrals from friends and co-workers, my passion and excitement has grown to a new level. I am very proud to be a part of the ATC family and boast about this company every opportunity I get. ATC is such a diverse company eager to help agents meet their goals!!!\n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nAmerica’s Travel Companies is one of the best host agencies in the industry. They celebrate 20 plus years in the industry and have developed great supplier/client relations. I have been an independent travel agent with ATC for over 10 years and enjoy every facet of it. I began selling travel and learning the industry by planning vacations for myself and family. My venture turned into a revenue producing travel business strictly by word of mouth. ATC has been my biggest cheerleader. They dedicated agent support to help you succeed no matter how small or large your business is. They also foster a fabulous agent community by supporting networking events so you can meet other professionals in your area. ATC is a leader in providing accessible tools for you to reach your goals. \nOnce the business aspect of the industry was explained to me, I had no trouble achieving IATA status and increasing my sales to over $200k annually. My fundamental reason for supporting ATC is they support all their agents while providing a family environment. The staff knows each agent by name. Agents are never considered a number or a product. I love the culture ATC promotes with its agents. Encouragement, caring, unlimited possibilities and business development. They recognize agents for their sales as well as agent development. Is a boutique agency you will want to be a part of.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nAmerica's Travel Companies is always there when you need them. They are more than just a Host Agency, they are like a family. \nThey offer the training you need to help you succeed in growing your travel business.\nI have been with ATC for 17 years and have achieved my goal of reaching IATAN status, growing my annual gross sales to over 100k along with earning top commission.\n6\n2\n6 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "Archer Travel Group Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nAH-Maz-Ing! The freedom this company has provided is phenomenal! I worked in corporate America for almost 30 years and lost my 25-year career due to COVID - they closed our local office and eliminated my position. \nThe atmosphere, support, perks, training, and friendships I've found here are like nothing I've ever experienced. Everyone wants everyone to succeed and it really shows considering most of the training is done by volunteers - they're not getting paid extra for sharing their knowledge with us! I earn 80% of all paid-out commissions, I've earned my IATAN card, I've earned free cruises, and discounted hotel rates, I've even joined the OPTIONAL mentorship program (the \"hybrid\" MLM model) and earn residual income every month by sharing this opportunity with others. \nThe best part? I get to stay home and work at my own pace, and I don't have to put my kid on a bus every morning so that I can drive to an office and work 8 hours and ask for permission to use my earned vacation time. \nThe other great thing about this - you can come in and try it out risk-free - they actually offer a 10-day money-back guarantee. Come in, get your certification, and try out some of the training, if within the first 10 days - you don't feel the opportunity is right for you, cancel and get your full refund. \nLisa Brulinski\nI've been with Archer over 3 years and when I started I had only done my own travel, so I knew the basic. The support team is amazing and they provide so much training that it gets over whelming, so you have to take one step at a time, but it's well worth it. We are truly a family and everyone works together for the greater good of the travel advisors. I wouldn't want to go any where else. \n1\n3\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nArcher and Evolution travel are an incredible company to work with. The freedom, flexibilty and access we have is amazing and I am able to truly run my travel business as I see fit with the support I need. For what you spend per month, it's the same as buying your $4 latte 5 days a week on your way to work; except this brings you income. This is a business and it does take work, but be coachable, take what is being taught and apply it and you can truly change your life.\n1\n2\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nMy experience with ARCHER TRAVEL GROUP / EVOLUTION ENTERPRISES has been quite disappointing & such a waste of my valuable time! I was lured on LinkedIn by THREE different job opportunities (Remote Travel Partner, Travel Planning Assistant & Virtual Scheduling Assisant) only to find out, that these three different companies all ended up being the same SCAM – ARCHER!!!!! I was interested in positions offered by “Believe Travel Australia; Maritza Solis from Believe Travel based supposedly in Cusco, Peru; and SeaBreeze Homes and Living by Johnny V and Elizabeth in Sarasota, Southwest Florida – www.seabreezehomesandliving.com.” \nI submitted my interested and then was scheduled quickly for an online Zoom meeting. I attended all three which lasted just over an hour ONLY to find out that they all revolve around the same scam concept…to recruit more people into a multi-level marketing (MLM) scheme! While the company initially presents itself as a professional opportunity in the travel industry, the primary focus seems to be on them expanding a recruitment network where they make $$$$ as you are required to pay an Enrollment/Initiation Fee of either $89.98USD (ESSENTIALS PACKAGE) or $299.00USD (BUNDLE PACKAGE) plus a monthly fee of $89.99USD! \nTheir focus is to generate revenue for themselves through recruitment rather than offering value or real opportunities in the travel industry. In order for a travel agent to cover $89.99USD a month, they would have to sell over $1125USD in travel a month just to cover their monthly fee! They promote that they offer the HIGHEST COMMISSIONS IN THE INDUSTRY where 80% is for the PROFESSIONAL TRAVEL AGENT and 20% is for ARCHER TRAVEL. \nARCHER TRAVEL GROUP / EVOLUTION ENTERPRISES AKA BELIEVE (AND WHAT OTHER NAMES THEY USE) was a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! I would not recommend this to anyone seeking a legitimate opportunity in the travel industry. They should be banned from marketing such fake work opportunities! \n13\n44\n13 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI joined the team around two years ago, coming in with little knowledge about host agencies or the travel industry, apart from my passion for exploring new places! Once I discovered that I could enjoy the benefits and discounts of being a travel agent, I decided to take the plunge. I couldn't be happier with my choice. In my first year, I focused on booking my own travels. Then, last year, I began arranging trips for others occasionally. There are countless training opportunities and events available, which can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, all the training sessions are completely free, and my professional organization allows me to count these trainings as PDUs! It truly is a win-win situation for me! This year, I attended the convention, and I know that next year, I won't miss it for anything! It's amazing that they are able to trust individuals using their name to get access to the vendors and all other travel agents that this seriously and the team we have formed is amazing, I will never leave! Plus, I do not have an hourly boss cutting down my throat so that he can get ahead with his career and botch mine! I am my OWN DESTINY here and Archer Travel makes sure I succeed!\n1\n4\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI wanted to take a minute to talk about Archer because let’s be real, they sometimes get a bad rap for being labeled as an MLM. Here’s the deal—Yes, you can mentor other agents if you want to, but NO, it’s not something you have to do!\nI genuinely love being part of this company. Ron Archer and Reggie Rivas are so supportive—they even have an open-door (or open-phone!) policy. It’s a big company, but it still feels like a close-knit family.\nArcher offers tons of training opportunities, but it’s up to each agent to show up, put in the effort, ask questions, and take advantage of what’s available. Honestly, I think some of the negative reviews come from people expecting everything to be handed to them. At the end of the day, this is a business opportunity. The tools and resources are there—you just have to use them. \nAnd let me tell you, the support from this host agency? Absolutely incredible!\n2\n8\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWhile we are considered a hybrid, we are first and foremost travel agents. Because many of us love what we do and only found this amazing opportunity because someone invited us to hear about it, we choose to team build. Archer has been fabulous! The support we get from everyone is amazing. We even have Ron Archer’s phone number! I will say that some of the info on this site is incorrect as we receive 80% of the commission and we do have E & O insurance. There are daily trainings both from Archer as well as our teams so you are always in the know. Help is always a phone call, zoom or email away. \n1\n4\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nHi Cynthia! \nJust reaching out regarding the information about Archer and E & O insurance, etc. The host agencies are responsible for updating their own information here. You should reach out to Archer if it's incorrect. \nThanks! \nAbbey and the HAR team \nI came on here to review Archer since honestly they get a bad rap for supposedly being an MLM. Is there an option to mentor other agents? Yes. Do you have to? No! This past year I was awarded the #1 travel booker for Archer. I love this company. Ron Archer and Reggie Rivas are here for their agents. They have an open door (phone call) policy. It is a big company with a small compay family feel. Archer offers so many trainings. It is up to the agent though to get themselves to the trainings, to learn, to ask questions. Many times the people writing the negative reviews want everything handed to them. This is a business opportunity. The tools are there but we can't force people to use them. 2023 I booked $900,000 of travel with the support of this AMAZING host agency!\n2\n4\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nHi Jodi! \nJust reaching out to clarify that Archer is what we call an MLM hybrid, since the group has an essential relationship with Evolution. \nBest,\nAbbey and the HAR Team \nI've been with Archer Travel for just over nine months, and it's been an incredible journey! Dreaming of a career in travel, I spent years booking trips for friends and family, wishing I could turn my passion into a profession. When the opportunity with Archer presented itself, I jumped at it.\nBest decision ever! The training and support I've received from my team have been exceptional. I've even transitioned into training new and seasoned agents myself, which I absolutely love. Beyond the invaluable knowledge and resources, I've built incredible friendships and connections within the Archer community.\nThe team is incredibly responsive and supportive, always ready to assist with any questions or challenges. I'm truly grateful for the opportunity to build my travel business with Archer!\n2\n2\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nBad company will not refund my monthly payment I paid. They're misleading in saying they give you marketing when they don't. I will file a complaint to the BBB and let people know on facebook. I would not go with this company as agent or a travel customer. They mislead on what an agent gets when they sign up and then don't want to refund the monthly payment. \n5\n19\n5 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI joined Archer knowing it was an MLM but being assured that I didn't have to participate in the team building and that the training was very good. Needless to say, I was lied to. They didn't bug me about team building, but the training is awful. The \"travel agent certification\" took me about an hour, I heard nothing about duty of care until I found it on my own months later, when I had issues logging into suppliers or needed guidance, the answer was usually some sort of go read the directions. Early on I had an issue with returning rental cars to a different destination on VAX. When I asked how to do this, I got no guidance. Turned out to be a simple fix of choosing the rental company before choosing the return location. After the ridiculous \"certification\", I was told to just start registering with suppliers. No guidance on where to start or which would be the most useful. Find a niche was the only response when I asked. How do you do that when you know next to nothing about the industry? How do I find that niche? Silence. There are lots of webinars from suppliers and destination tourist boards, but nothing about ethics, business development, how to market was essentially ‘post on Facebook’. The problem is that Evolution puts team building before actual travel, so even if you are on a team that does want to book, they aren’t given the resources or support. No one, from my mentor (who was also my good friend) to my up-line, ever checked to see how I was managing, what I needed, or how I was progressing. I did most of my training from other sources on my own. Archer didn’t allow us to use most of the tools in Travel Leaders, which is unfortunate because that was the best tool I received. TLN’s training helped me a lot. Recently, my mentor passed away with clients still needing help. I stepped up to help finish the trips after being asked. Unfortunately, other personal circumstances meant that I also needed to change hosts. Instead of allowing me to administer the trips and keeping the bookings at Archer, they got very nasty with me. Archer did nothing to help all but one of the clients. No one contacted the clients even after one client contacted them about how to proceed. After joining my new host, I was shocked at how much more support I got. The Facebook group is so much more active with suggestions on suppliers, destinations, hotels, info from fam trips, and much more. Archer does not support its agents past the monthly fee and they won’t support clients when something goes wrong. I made a mistake in believing the lies from Archer agents so you don’t have to. Don’t waste your money, time, or integrity with Archer. \n24\n41\n24 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews.\nWe collect cookies.

  "text": "ATHome by Atlas Travel Host Reviews\nATHome has been the perfect host agency for me in so many aspects. I was new to the industry when I became a member of ATHome, and their Member Engagement Manager was so helpful, friendly & understanding with all of my questions. Their online training was thorough, user-friendly and engaging, and they continuously update and enhance their online resources. Whenever I reach out with questions, they are quick to respond not only to the question at hand, but to offer additional advice and guidance. \nEven though I work from home, I can sense the spirit of camaraderie among everyone I have interacted with at ATHome. They are supportive of each other, and of their independent agents. The entire organization truly seems to work together as a team…it is not uncommon for me to receive a response to my questions directly from the C-suite.\nATHome offers many training webinars with suppliers on a regular basis, and they hold recurring “Let’s Chat” zooms with all members in order to communicate updates, provide refreshers, and facilitate a chance for members to ask questions and share best practices. I thoroughly enjoy these zooms not only for the information I learn, but for the chance to “e-mingle” with others!\nATHome’s affiliation with Signature Travel Network also provides so much opportunity for its members, from the preferred suppliers, to the marketing materials, to the wide breadth of training offerings. Signature offers a Travel Expert Select program for advisors interested in specializing in a particular destination or special interest. When I decided to apply for this program, ATHome’s executive team was so supportive of my goal, and so generous with their time by reviewing and approving my submission to apply for the program. I am so grateful to the CFO and CMO for their support in helping me to successfully join this program.\nDue to ATHome’s affiliation with Signature, I had the good fortune of being able to attend Signature’s annual conference this year, which provides a wealth of knowledge to attendees through its general sessions and workshops, and also facilitates amazing opportunities to meet and connect with an expansive variety of Signature’s preferred suppliers. However, what was equally special to me was the opportunity to spend time with individuals from ATHome while we were there. Being able to get to know them in person, and to discuss their experiences and advice, was so valuable…not only was it an incredible learning experience, but it filled my cup to feel that sense of camaraderie in person.\nIn summary, I’m so grateful that – after taking into consideration the guidance provided by HAR regarding choosing a host  – I decided on ATHome. To anyone going through the process of choosing a host, I can’t recommend ATHome enough!"

  "text": "Academy Travel Inc Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nI have been with Academy Travel for just under two years now and I love it! I looked around at several other agencies before I chose which agency I was most interested in and Academy was my top choice by far! And, I am so glad that I made that choice. Jayne is wonderful! If you need anything, she will do everything she can to help you. And the team is very friendly! We have multiple resources for training including on site trainings (which have been at least twice a year since I joined) and they are very reasonably priced. I am looking forward to many more years with the Academy Travel family!\nAmy\nI have been an agent with Academy Travel for almost a year and I LOVE it. Jayne is there for every single question I have, and if she isn't there are many other amazing team members who are just as amazing as she is to help me. \nTraining is ongoing and at least one a week we have a webinar to go over all kinds of different training tools and help. \nThe agency also is great because you get added benefits working for a Diamond status agency such as extra Disney World/Disneyland tickets, and Academy Travel is ALWAYS giving us agent appreciated trips. Always. They have 3 scheduled just in the next 8 months! Cruises, Universal, Disney, all around the world. \nI just love this agency and I am proud to work for them.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been working with Academy Travel since 2010. I can’t say enough about this company. Lisa and Jayne are so helpful and knowledgeable with yravel. They both will help their agents as much as they can. I am grateful for all the trainings they have available. I would recommend this company to anyone who would want to be a travel agent! \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI can not say enough wonderful things about Academy Travel Lisa and Jayne are amazing. The support is outstanding. Love working for Academy.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI love love love Lisa and the team at Academy and that makes me very suspicious of the negative reviews here. Lisa and Jayne are like family and have really taken the time to take me under their wings and truly train me. My previous agency did no such thing.\n3\n1\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI started off with this host agency a couple years and they just did Disney vacations. It was really good for that (Jayne is top of the line great), but when they expanded to \"the rest of the world\"... it got to where there was little to no support with it. I loves a group who wanted to cruise for a reunion, as well as a home school group because of the lack of communication with that part of the agency. I switched at that point.\n17\n10\n17 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nMy only explanation of satisfactory reviews is that the company is asking current employees to write them. \nNo agent of experience would write a reputable review for this company. \nThere is zero communication with Jayne. And Lisa never once made contact with me during my entire employment with them. \nThey charge fees to book other vendors- and don't expect to receive this information in any timely fashion.\nYou're nickel and dimed for documents and mailings. \nThere are many other agencies that will provide you with the support you need to get started in a professional manner.\nI ran from this company as quickly as I could.\n34\n35\n34 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI was with Academy Travel for over 2 years and that was long enough! Anyone that says they are a great agency has clearly been drinking the \"kool-aid\". They live in the dark ages with no direct deposit, fax in commission trackers, trying to use a blog for agents to ask questions and meet each other, making you pay for a book to book things other than Disney, and on top of it all they give you a terrible commission % on Disney . Jayne may say that she has experience but if you ask her a question 9/10 times her answer will be \"call the supplier\". I ask a question once which took over a week to get a reply and by then I had gotten an answer elsewhere, she answered it wrong and when I questioned her on it she said she was glad I found the answer. I should have trusted my gut that an agency that doesn't charge a fee to start up would be bad news. I waited 2 months for commissions that I should have received a month earlier. They warn you before you go on AEPs that are not hosted by them that to watch what other people say/do and now I know why, they don't want you learning how many great agencies are out there that give you great support, know you by name and appreciate you no matter if you are the top booking agent in the agency or just getting started. Many times after an agent goes to an AEP, they leave Academy Travel. Which is why they have resulted in doing more AEPs that are strictly for their agency and not allowing agents the opportunity to do the other ones to meet agents from other agencies. Do you research before joining this agency!\n26\n33\n26 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been with Academy Travel for just under two years now and I love it!

We have multiple resources for training including on site trainings (which have been at least twice a year since I joined) and they are very reasonably priced. I am looking forward to many more years with the Academy Travel family!\n20\n2\n20 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "BNT Travel Group Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nI was looking for a new host agency because I was tired of the monthly fees and unfair commission structure at my previous host. They kept 60% of the commission, and even charged penalties if I didn’t submit a paid vacation on the same day. With such strict rules and reduced income, I’m still surprised I managed to sell at all.\nWhen I saw the information about BNT Travel Group, I couldn’t believe my eyes — fair commissions and real support for agents. I was looking for an agency that would give me freedom of action, freedom of creativity, and at the same time provide answers to my questions.\nMr. Erokhin has built a very welcoming community of agents. Every time I have a question, I receive support and a detailed answer — either from the support team or from fellow agents.\nI am very grateful to be part of BNT Travel Group. Not only do I feel valued as an agent, but I also have the freedom to grow, create, and share my knowledge. I truly appreciate this community and am excited to continue building my business with BNT.\nDilara Khafizov\nI love how transparent the company is — fast email replies, clear and easy-to-understand commission structure, and excellent support. I especially appreciate that all my questions are answered promptly, which makes me feel confident and supported every step of the way. And a pretty nice bonus: there are no mandatory monthly fees. That’s definitely a win. \n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWould definitely recommend BNT. Low start up fee, easy to maintain your status, and all the tools & freedom you need to be successful. \nStarted about a year and a half ago, and have consistently grown ever since beginning. If you’re considering jumping in, take a leap and just do it. You’ll be glad you did! \n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nBecoming an independent travel agent was a big step for me. I wanted freedom, flexibility, and the ability to build my own business without being alone in the process. That’s exactly what I found with BNT Travel Group.\nHigh commissions: Now earn 90% \nNo monthly and annual fees. Period. \nFull support: Training, private mentor calls, and access to a private facebook community. \nStrong industry connections: BNT is part of Travel Leaders Network, so I get access to exclusive rates and booking tools.\nWith BNT, I feel like I’m running my own agency, but I also know I have a team behind me whenever I need help. It’s the perfect balance of independence and support.\nIf you’re thinking about becoming a travel agent or looking for a better host agency, I highly recommend BNT!\n3\n1\n3 people found this review helpful.

In the process of finding new clients and providing them with good service every day I have dozens of questions. BNT Travel Group has an amazing support team. They have professional skills and they always respond quickly. They provide us with training and marketing tools. BNT Travel Agents Facebook group also helps a lot.

Did you?\nI signed up with BNT Travel Group as my host agency in 2017 with no prior experience in the travel industry after speaking with a couple of other agents who started their travel careers with BNT, they were so confident that they chose the right host. BNT provides all the support and tools you need to learn the travel business and consistently provides the right suppliers, training, marketing tools. They have helped me grow my agency and I have grown with them as they grew also. BNT never delayed commission payments, I always get paid in time.

Did you?\nI have been with BNT for over 4 years now and I cannot say better things. Aside from the competitive pay structure, one of the best things about working here is the support system and guidance that you get from fellow agents and the company itself. I've been in the industry for over 15 years so I have had my fair share of host agency experiences and this has been the best, pro-agent one so far. \n9\n2\n9 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI love being in the travel industry! I am retired, but work with BNT by selling travel to make extra income. It's perfect for me. Don't have to leave the house and doing what I love. BNT did a wonderful job supporting agents during pandemic tough times, not a good for the travel industry. I have never spent a day being confused about what is going on. I also appreciate the leadership and their ability to hold the vision for us as we navigate the uncertainty. \nCouldn't have a better host agency! \n9\n0\n9 people found this review helpful.

I started with them about 2 years ago, and they have steadily grown and are adding suppliers frequently. They offer great support, encouragement and training. They nurture a welcoming and positive environment. I have been really happy with them as my business has grown. \nKim Parr\nBoardwalk Travel Agency has always been so supportive and helpful.

Did you?\nI joined Boardwalk in early 2023 with hopes of having a job that would allow me to still be present for my kids. This adventure has exceeded my expectations! I've always loved to travel, and loved to plan travel. (I've always kind of been the \"go to\" travel person with my family and friends.)

This agency is determined to make sure that their agents feel supported and comfortable. Fellow agents are ready to answer questions and ease concerns without judgement.

  "text": "Brownell Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nWhen I was curious about moving into the travel industry ten years ago, a trusted friend told me that Brownell was the way to go, and they were absolutely right! I found the mentoring program and was lucky enough to be selected for the exclusive class. I was properly trained, and was able to learn as I built my business in the first year. After graduating from the mentoring year, I have always been very pleased with Brownell. \nNot only am I surrounded by some of the top advisors in the business, I feel constantly supported by the hosting team and my colleagues. Especially in the early years when I ran into bumps, or had issues come up, the hosting team always reassured me, pointed me in the right direction, and had my back. I am grateful they are always there for the little and big questions. \nI'm also grateful for their support with all of my accounting, helping me develop my relationships within the business, and nurture clients. The marketing is also extremely helpful, I would love to do more of this but I just don't have the time, so I'm glad they are able to help me out. \nOverall, I couldn't be happier with Brownell and am grateful to be a part of their wonderful family! \nCourtney Regan\nWhen I was searching for a host agency, a friend introduced me to Brownell. Their Mentoring Program was truly a game-changer for me. As someone new to the industry, Brownell’s training gave me the resources, skills, confidence, and foundation I needed to successfully launch my travel business.\nThe support Brownell offers is second to none. They provide support across every area, including marketing, sales, air, insurance, and more through dedicated teams and resources. For new advisors, the partnerships Brownell has built over the years are invaluable in helping create meaningful experiences for clients.\nMost of all, I love the people. Whenever I’ve run into a challenge, the Brownell team has been ready to step in and help. The community of advisors is equally generous, always willing to share tips, best practices, and hard-earned wisdom. I am extremely grateful for Brownell and can’t imagine starting my travel business anywhere else!\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nMargaret Haas Wolf\nEllie, what a lovely review!! Thank you for taking the time. You have worked so hard to build your business, and we are proud of all that you've already accomplished! Looking forward to having a front row seat for all your future holds. \nJoining the Catalyst Program with Brownell Travel has completely transformed my business. By the halfway point of the program, I had already surpassed my annual sales from the previous year—something I never imagined possible so quickly. The mentorship and guidance I received helped me streamline my operations, focus on what truly matters, and build my confidence as a luxury travel advisor.\nWhat makes Brownell truly special is their incredible support system. Whether it’s the Partner Relations team, the Air and Insurance Desks, or the Hosting and Marketing teams, there’s always someone ready to help. Their resources have made it so much easier for me to focus on delivering exceptional service to my clients. And thanks to Brownell’s strong industry relationships, I’ve experienced firsthand how quickly partners respond with respect and care.\nI’m so grateful to be part of the Brownell family—the Catalyst Program has been a game-changer, and I’m excited to keep growing and creating incredible experiences for my clients.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nMargaret Haas Wolf\nAllie - What a nice message to start the new year! We are so glad to have had you in our first Catalyst class, and thrilled to see your success and feel your joy. Congratulations on all your success thus far, much more to come!\nI can't say enough wonderful things about my experience with Brownell. Their mentor program is phenomenal --- provides you with real time training so you can literally hit the ground running while launching your travel business. The hosting support is fantastic and the leadership team genuinely cares about the success of their advisors. The continuous professional development opportunities are endless, and partner relationships are so valuable. I'm extremely grateful to have landed with Brownell. Many days I feel like I have to pinch myself as I can't believe I'm so lucky for this to be my career.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nKerry Dyer\nMolly WE are grateful you landed with Brownell! You have put a ton of hard work into building your business with no shortage of crazy things happening on the home front!! We are very proud of all you've done, and will continue to do! \nThere are many reasons I am grateful to be partnered with Brownell. It's repeatedly evident to me how highly regarded Brownell is with our partners across the globe. The strength of these relationships allows me to access incredible resources through our partners for my clients. My mentoring year with Brownell was so incredibly impressive. Methodical, intentional, thorough; I cannot imagine being able to start my business and succeed to the level I did in my first year, without the powerhouse that is Brownell behind me. \nOur community of advisors are incredibly collaborative. Our Slack channel is full of valuable information and all of us are quick to jump in and offer advice, suggestions, or guidance on whatever an advisor needs. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nKerry Dyer\nMichele, we feel so lucky to have you, and I love how you are just as willing to jump in and help your colleagues. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts! \nI feel so fortunate to be part of the Brownell community! After nearly 15 years in PR and Marketing, including a focus on travel and leisure, I joined Brownell through mentorship from a Brownell advisor who graciously welcomed me. Through her guidance and the incredible support of the Brownell community, from our Partner Relations, Insurance Desk, and Air Desk teams to the Hosting, Accounting and IT support teams, community of ICs and staff, and leadership team, my business quickly grew. I'm so thankful to be affiliated with an agency that is committed to a set of core values to which I also remain committed.\nI truly feel the power of Brownell and the strong relationships that have been cultivated by other Brownell advisors, the leadership team and the Partners Team when I reach out to partners with whom I do not have an existing relationship. These partners respond with such immediacy and with such respect for me, my clients and our team. Our mission at Catherine Denham Travel is, is the words of Will Guidara, to deliver \"unreasonable hospitality\" in our quest to craft exceptional travel experiences for our clients. The tools to which we have access, married with the relationships cultivated by the Brownell community, help us succeed in this mission day in and day out!\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nKerry Dyer\nCatherine - What a thoughtful review!! Your success is a huge testament to your hard work and tenacity and it is matched in every way by your enthusiasm and warmth. We are so lucky to have you at Brownell! \nIn 2015 I applied for the mentoring program with Brownell because I wanted to get into luxury travel but had no idea how to start. I chose Brownell because of its core values (Passion, Integrity, Graciousness, Excellence, Innovation, and Curiosity) which aligned with how I try to live every day. I also knew they were very respected in the industry, so that's what I wanted to be a part of. It's been the best experience and exceeded my expectations and gave me the skills to sell over $1.5M each year. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nKerry Dyer\nKiki, thank you so much for your review!! We love having you as part of the community, and are so proud of the business you have built! \nI am over-the-moon about my choice to move to Brownell Travel! I have been in the industry over four years and my book of business was growing each year. However, I wanted to “take the reins” and control the growth intentionally. I knew that would mean a change in my host agency. \nBrownell has always stood out to me as a leader in the industry, not just because of their impressive numbers, but also due to their reputation of graciousness. From the moment I reached out to them until I completed my personalized one-on-one training, I was blown away by their professionalism, hospitality and assistance. The amount of resources they offer along with a common thread of motivation and support encourages me to be the very best I can be, both professionally and personally.\nI am truly humbled and honored to be a part of the Brownell Community. I would encourage anyone that is hard-working and passionate about travel to consider researching this agency to see if they are the perfect fit for their business. \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nKerry Dyer\nAJ, you have no idea how much this means to us! We are thrilled you chose us and for all the right reasons. We look forward to continuing to work hard with you and help you build the business you want to build. \nBrownell's marketing support for their ICs is outstanding. One of the many options they offer as part of their product suite is social media customization and deployment across all channels. This particular service was a godsend for me when I was underwater throughout 2021 and 2022 and didn’t have the time or desire to dedicate to this aspect of my marketing plan. This service was worth every penny. It allowed me to focus on keeping my clients happy, my service levels at a high standard, and my social media strategy consistent and on point. It was cost-effective and reliable. No wasted time searching UpWork and Fiverr for the \"right\" contractor. I've now built my business to the point of being able to hire staff to handle social media tasks, but we still rely on their editorial calendar for ideas and inspiration. Could not have kept this up without them!\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nKerry Dyer\nRachel, thank you for this awesome shout out to our Marketing team! They work so hard and I am thrilled they were able to bolster you through this transition, and continue to support your social media and marketing inspiration! \nMy story with Brownell is not traditional as I did not participate in the mentoring program. Instead, I spent ten years as a travel coordinator (assistant) for a top producing Brownell IC and with the support of my IC, had the gradual intention of becoming an IC myself. This goal became a reality in 2021 post pandemic. With guidance and support from my IC \"boss\" and from the Brownell Hosting team, I was able to transition from a support role to an IC role with my own business. Brownell welcomed me and my skillset and provided all of the resources and know-how to successfully create my business and hit the ground running selling travel. I cannot say enough about the level of comfort I had launching a business with this kind, caring and well-respected host agency! Key factors for remaining with Brownell were the overwhelming sense of community among advisors, excellent support from the Brownell accounting and hosting teams and intense pride of being associated with such a well-respected host agency. Icing on the cake is the Brownell air desk, insurance desk and task support available to all IC's on an as needed basis. With only a few months left into my second year as an IC, I can honestly say Brownell is a wonderful place to call \"home\".\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nKerry Dyer\nSarah, we have loved being your home!! There are many paths to building your own successful business, and we are proud to be here for you as you continue to grow yours. Thank you!\nI started with Brownell 5 years ago through the Mentoring Program and honestly has been the best career move I have ever made! I had only done corporate travel before starting at Brownell, and the team provided such amazing excellent support and resources to really jump-start my business. I came from an HR background - so I can truly say the training I received was thoughtful, thorough and first-class. Beyond the success of the Brownell travel advisors, one of the things that really attracted me to Brownell was the strong mission and values of the company that is a part of everything we do. The values are not just something written on paper but really integrated into the business and all decision-making. I feel like I am surrounded by the best of the best in the travel industry, and whenever I have any questions I have a dedicated expert team to help. Having a million-dollar travel business within 5 years was beyond my wildest expectations - and I know I could not have done it without the extraordinary support of the Brownell family. Thank you!!\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nKerry Dyer\nJessica, we are so glad you decided to make the leap in your career and join us!

From day one, the environment felt like family, and that ethos remains at the heart of the organization.

As the client, I was incredibly impressed with their high quality service, creativity and strong partnership. After retiring from corporate, I was thrilled to join Wendy's incredible Advisor community. Wendy leads a talented team of professionals that support Advisors with exceptional partnerships, information, training and support. I was very green as an \"agent\" and the Host and Advisor teams have been incredible supporting my business. Cadence lives their values, they truly care and their energy is contagious.

From the moment I joined, I was impressed by their professionalism and commitment to supporting travel advisors. The agency’s vast resources and comprehensive training programs have significantly enhanced my ability to deliver exceptional service to my clients.\nOne of the standout features of Global Travel Collection is their extensive network of preferred suppliers. This access not only provides me with competitive pricing but also ensures that my clients receive exclusive perks and benefits that enhance their travel experiences. The agency’s strong relationships with top-tier hotels, cruise lines, and tour operators have proven invaluable in curating unique and memorable itineraries.\nMoreover, the ongoing support from the Global Travel Collection team has been remarkable. They are always available to answer questions, provide guidance, and share industry insights. The collaborative culture fosters a sense of community among advisors, making it easy to exchange ideas and best practices. The regular webinars and training sessions are also incredibly beneficial, keeping us abreast of the latest trends and developments in the travel industry.\nIn addition, the technology platform offered by Global Travel Collection is user-friendly and efficient, streamlining the booking process and allowing me to focus more on my clients rather than administrative tasks. This efficiency contributes to a more productive work environment and ultimately enhances client satisfaction.\nOverall, I wholeheartedly recommend Global Travel Collection to any travel advisor seeking a robust and supportive host agency.

They are very helpful in all aspects of travel.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nStay away. They have no system for tracking the information you upload to their website for bookings and your commissions. You have to call to hunt down your commission payments. They will tell you they haven't received the commission payments when indeed they have. Also you'll never get any communication on promotions, sales, training or familiarization trips. They also advertise themselves as being members of CLIA and NACTA which they are not. They will randomly change your commission level percentage on already booked and traveled bookings without notifying you as well. There are far better options out there for both starting and seasoned agents.\n7\n0\n7 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have now been with Casino World Travel for a full year now, have no idea why I waited so long. I guess it was to good to be true after being with my previous host agency. Though I loved all whom I worked with, CWT is definitely a better fit for me and my clients. Sheri and Vinny cannot, let me repeat, cannot be more encouraging and helpful! Have never been paid so quickly or as much previously! Absolutely no pressure for sales only encouragement via emails and phone calls. They seem to never sleep, always on call and ready to help!

We had started with another home-based company approximately 8 months prior, but we received minimal support. In those 8 months, we only had a handful of bookings, and most of them were our own reservations.\nWhile attending the CLIA conference in April of 2019, we saw alot of people wearing the \"CP green\" shirts. So, we started asking some of them about Cruise Planners. Every single person we spoke with said they absolutely LOVED Cruise Planners, and they were very happy with their decision to join the CP family.\nAfter more research, we decided to make the switch, and we are extremely happy that we did!\nThe support that we've received from the Cruise Planners home office has been fantastic. The CP technology is state-of-the-art. The coaches are very responsive, and they are in place to help us build our businesses. In addition, having access to the Facebook page that is set up for CP advisors has allowed me to obtain a significant amount of super helpful information from my CP colleagues. \nThe CP home office staff truly cares, and they are very supportive, and we really feel that they want us to succeed. In addition to the cutting edge technology and the outstanding coaching, they also provide marketing, training, and more.\nMy husband and I set a goal for ourselves to make the company's Top 50 list within our first five years. We were able to accomplish our goal within our first year- even with the COVID situation in full swing. We have now built our business into a multi-million dollar company, and we could not be more happy with our Cruise Planners franchise."

  "text": "Avoya Travel Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nI left Avoya after 6 months due to disagreement with their commission structure for leads and their marketing philosophy. I have been in sales my whole career - and this is the only company I know where the customer cannot choose who they work with. \nAs a new TA, I was enticed by the training and onboarding program, and the opportunity to get leads with Avoya. However, after I earned $80 on a $5000 cruise I realized their model is flawed. Basically, you earn 4.8% on most cruise leads - it is a 30-70 split on leads, with 30% to you....after deducting any offers you made to the client. \nThey want you to sell on value, but in training the first thing they push is to offer a discount or onboard credit. What they don't tell you is that any OBC you offer is deducted from your commission at the 80/20 or 30/70 lead split. Teaching you to offer a discount on your iniital call with a client is not adding value, and cuts your pay.\nAvoya spends a lot of marketing, and they want to protect their investment - but the reason the leads stay with Avoya is because of the TA and how we bring the lead to closure, and maintain the customer relationship. However, they still keep the 30-70 split on all future deals as well.Even though they were only responsible for the initial lead. \nAnd then we received a letter from their CEO that said they would sue any TA that left and worked with a client that was previously a lead. Meaning the customers you had fostered and nurtured were not allowed to leave Avoya and follow you. Never in my career had I ever seen a policy like this - while I should not be allowed to poach any leads if I left, a customer should be able to use me if they wanted to, and found me on their own. Avoya threatened all agents with lawsuits should a client follow us no matter what. That is not a company I wanted to be associated with. \nI left and am very happy with my new agency I am associated with."

Did you?\nI started in tourism in 1998 on the supplier side, owning and operating an excursion company. We were the largest and most popular activity in the area and the ski area used us extensively for corporate groups. In 2005, with the assistance of a friend that was working at the ski area I started a travel agency. I worked inbound corporate groups until 2018. I then changed my business model and moved to outbound leisure. My first year was a struggle without the backing and resources that come with having a host agency. I was incredibly fortunate to have a conversation that lead to an introduction to Montecito Village Travel. I feel so grateful that I'm an IC with them. I have the support, resources, and backing that I didn't even know existed. I was just getting going with them when COVID hit. The encouragement and help from them was so appreciated. I don't know that I would have continued in the business without that. Now that travel is booming again I have everything I need to be successful. From the systems they have in place, educational opportunities, and networking it's all there. Not to mention it feels like you are part of a family. They are wonderful to know and work with. If I ever have a question or need assistance they are there for me. Thank you MVT, I'm looking forward to many more sucessful years together!\n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI changed my host company to Montecito Village Travel about a year ago and I'm still in awe at how great this host company is. \nThey have exceeded all my expectations when it comes to providing support and the tools needed for my success. Their in-house system is the best I've seen, offering everything from tracking commissions, sending brochures, invoicing clients, and even a calendar for headquarters staff, showing when they are out of the office. \nThe company has invested an enormous amount of time and I'm sure money, to make sure we have what we need to be successful, yet they don't charge a fee for using their system. The idea that they are successful when we are is backed up by everything they provide and do for us, versus other companies that say it but don't back it up through actions and tools. \nThey are always offering webinars weekly, with different vendors and also their in-house team, highlighting their system, marketing ideas, networking and everything else you could think of. Not only are these great tools but nearly every webinar has an incentive with the opportunity to win a gift card plus for their in-house webinars, an Amazon gift card is given all attendees. \nTheir high volume with the different vendors, cruise lines and hotels is at a level where the commission %'s are either on par or higher than I've seen elsewhere, meaning more money in our pockets! \nAlthough Montecito is a large volume agency, they have a small company attitude. Everyone, from the President down is available if needed and there's never a feeling that anyone is \"above\" or too busy to help or even answer a question. \nI've been in the industry over 40 years and it takes a lot to impress me this much but they have. \n7\n1\n7 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been in the Travel Industry for almost 30 years. After starting in a Brick & Mortar Travel Agency and then moving to a long stint with Corporate Travel, I wanted to get back into Leisure Travel. I founded my agency Infinity Travelaz in 2013 and signed on with a different Host Agency. In 2020 I wanted to take my business up a notch and I moved to Montecito Village Travel. What a great move this has been on my part! MVT is on top of everything! When Covid hit, we had daily communications, weekly emails from the CEO and constant thank yous for sticking with them and hanging in there during what turned out to be a very trying year in the Travel Industry. Just knowing that I moved to a Host Agency that keeps in constant contact, cares deeply about our business and wants to help us succeed in anyway they can ensures my decision to join them was totally the right one! Their main data base where information, tools to help us, accounting information, training, webinars and so much more is housed is unlike I have ever experienced before! So much to help us, it is just amazing! The staff is kind and caring and quick to answer questions or answer emails. The connection with Virtuoso is awesome and gives us another way to ensure our success. Thank you Montecito Village Travel for taking me on during such a tumultuous time. I am looking forward to many more years of this great relationship. You all are awesome! \n8\n0\n8 people found this review helpful.

I also like that they continue to have new resources that makes my life easier. It feels really good to know that I don't have to know everything; that I can pick up the phone or email my direct contact at Your Travel Center and someone who has the answer/solutions will provide me with it in a timely manner. I highly recommend Your Travel Center as the host to work with.\n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful.

Did you?\nI have over 35 years of travel industry experience. I've spent most of my tenure working for major suppliers. Travel agents were my bread and butter. 14 months ago, I filled a lifelong dream to open my own travel company after years of guiding friends and family with their travel. I have never looked back. I worked closely with the Montecito Village Travel executives throughout much of my career and so it was a very natural fit for me to become an IC with MVT. When a long time travel agency owner, friend and colleague realized I was 100% serious about my business, she suggested I speak with MVT about joining the MVT Host family. It was seamless. My strengths are in building relationships, selling and creative marketing. My skills were not on the inner working of a travel agency. Back-office and procedures did not come easy. The MVT team from the top down are incredibly supportive. I can pick up the phone or send an email and no question is too small. I get to contribute. I learn, I ask questions and I receive top commissions and access to new suppliers and promotions. I feel as if I have the Fast Pass at Disneyland! I have learned so much this past year and I am so motivated to be the BEST with the incentives in place. I recommend MVT as a natural choice to other suppliers thinking about making the cross over that I did. I never even thought about looking at another affiliation (even though I know most of them). For me, MVT is my best choice. I am supported with Training, Technology, Marketing, Networking with piers, and Accounting. MVT cares about my success and they rally me on with support and equal excitement. I am grateful!\n17\n1\n17 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "Gifted Travel Network Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nA passion project in retirement that turned into a thriving business: Two reasons why and the how: \nFirst, a little background: After twenty years of trading risk arbitrage and equity derivatives in downtown manhattan, the time had come for chapter two, or no chapter at all; the latter option was not appealing. My dad said, \"what about being a travel advisor? You love to travel, have a great client list and have been to +60 countries. We use an advisor and it makes all the difference in the world?\" I love the idea, but where do you begin?\nWith Wall Street clientele, the appeal of Virtuoso as the luxury leader in travel helped me narrow my search for a host agency on this very site. The other requirement was a real education; only GTN had both. The year-long program was vital to my success. One could launch without the education on the back of my extensive travel and business experience, but aren't your odds of success drastically higher if you are a true expert? Doesn't that take immersion and mentorship? Would I have done more damage to my budding travel reputation with the finance clients I hoped to convert to travel clients had I not? Would I get more than one chance from those clients?\nFast forward to December 2021, I am in GTN's top producers club (top 30) in my first full year of business! I am invited to the Virtuoso ultraluxe community, attended Belmond's signature Bellini event for 10 USA advisors in Sicily and was on a top producer retreat with GTN. Without education, it would not have unfolded this way and certainly not this quickly. \nThe second reason is: In real estate, the most valuable metric is location, location, location, but at a host agency, it is culture, culture, culture. The collaboration and support amongst advisors in our community is the silver bullet and goes hand in hand with the educational foundation of GTN. Imagine how much the collective mindshare benefits our clients. I was not expecting instant responses to questions or requests for advice yet opening up the browser to 7 responses in thirty minutes is common. It's another level of vetting and advocacy, but it only happens if the culture is there. We are not competing like local real estate agents who might compete for a listing in town. Our clients are worldwide, an enviable difference, and it means we are not competing so let's help each other win. We share tips, insights and experiences on our internal system in discussion groups that pale in comparison to snarky online forums. We travel together, 14 GTN advisors and I are just back from 12 days in Tanzania, and as a result, we grow together. It's made all the difference in professional growth inspired by culture and education. What more can you ask for?\nStuart Marra\nAfter nine years as a stay-at-home mom—and with a prior career in a completely unrelated field—I decided to jump headfirst into the travel industry. Before making that leap, I spent several months researching host agencies, and that process ultimately led me to Gifted Travel Network. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of such an exceptional company.\nWhat initially drew me to GTN was a podcast by Meredith Calloway, where she spoke candidly about how being a travel advisor should be a profitable business, not a hobby. She shared lessons from her early career and explained how she intentionally built an agency and culture that teaches advisors to think like entrepreneurs from the very beginning. That message deeply resonated with me. While I knew I loved travel and would thrive in many aspects of this career, the business and entrepreneurial side felt intimidating—and GTN addressed that head-on.\nAs I continued my research and learned more about the Travel MBA program and the long-term mentorship offered beyond it, I knew GTN was the right fit. So far, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The Travel MBA program truly set me up for success—from Jumpstart week, to building a brand, to learning how to confidently and professionally plan complex trips for clients. I have done more business in my first year than I ever anticipated, and I attribute that directly to the education, resources, and connections GTN provides.\nBecause of GTN’s global partnerships and incredible advisor community, I now have the confidence to say “yes” to nearly any destination—China, Japan, Italy, France, and beyond—knowing I have trusted partners and fellow advisors willing to share their expertise. It’s an incredibly supportive environment, and while I work independently and run my own business, I truly feel like I’m part of something bigger.\nLastly, the support staff at GTN is outstanding. Their responsiveness, professionalism, and genuine care make an enormous difference and reinforce why choosing Gifted Travel Network was the best decision I could have made.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nGifted Travel Network has been an extraordinary partner throughout my journey as a luxury travel advisor. As my business, vision, and scope have grown over the years, the unwavering support, thoughtful education, and genuine investment in my success has never wavered. \nWhat truly sets Gifted Travel Network apart is the culture they have cultivated. This is an environment where advisors openly confide, collaborate, and champion one another. The belief that a rising tide raises all ships is not just a motto here, it is lived daily, and I have felt the impact of that collective strength at every stage of my growth.\nThe travel industry is a wild, wonderful roller coaster, and I am grateful to be part of a profession that blends passion with purpose, helping others experience the world more deeply. To be aligned with a host agency that embraces that ride with integrity, enthusiasm, and heart makes all the difference. I am truly thrilled to be partnered with Gifted Travel Network and excited for all that lies ahead. Rachael OBrien\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nMargaret Critz\nI came from a prior host agency that turned out to be the wrong fit for me. After watching the HAR webinar with Meredith, I knew I had to check out GTN, and I'm so glad I did!!\nJoining GTN, and especially the TMBA program, was one of those “oh, this was the right move!\" moments for me. \nWhen I started TMBA and met Amy, the mentors, and my cohort, I realized two things very quickly:\nI did not have to figure all of this out alone, and \nHonestly? It’s a whole lot better when you don’t.\nI talk to my cohort daily (sometimes more than my non–travel friends). I message mentors anytime I’m stuck, unsure, or just need someone who actually understands what I’m talking about. The whole GTN advisor community is the same way! Any question I post to the forum, they are open, generous, funny, whip-smart, and always ready to help.\nTMBA hasn’t just helped me build my business; it has helped me build my brand in a way that feels like me. I don’t just have a brand now; I live it. I show up in it. I understand how to speak from it. That alone has made all the difference.\nIf you’re looking for a place where you’re supported, cheered for, guided, and surrounded by people who genuinely want to see you win, GTN is it. I’m proud to be part of this community, and even prouder of the business I’m building because of it.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nWhile GTN was not the right fit for me I would recommend it be considered by new-to-industry advisors as they offer ground-up support. Every advisor has their own customized needs and it's essential to ask a lot of questions and ensure you will be matching yourself correctly. There is a helpful online community. \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI had a strong vision for the travel business I wanted to create, and I came to this very website to research host agencies because I thought this route made the most sense for me as a new business owner. I narrowed it down to a few I called, but it was Gifted Travel Network that stood out as the clear match for me. They were and are still committed to the success of the entrepreneurs in our network, and the women who run it are conscientious, forward-thinking, proactive, nurturing, and epitome of professionalism. I graduated from their Travel MBA program and incorporated my company in 2018 and never regretted my decision to partner with GTN. The members of our network are supportive, collaborative, and strive to be standard-bearers and excel in an industry with, frankly, a low barrier to entry. GTN is for serious-minded entrepreneurs who care deeply about the travel profession and the people in it. The accolades GTN has gathered over the years with Virtuoso, Forbes Travel Guide, and many awards for their various training programs and events are well-deserved and fairly won. The support from GTN is great, and the back-office systems enable me to be wildly efficient in running my business which is having record sales and supporting me financially. But GTN wants to make sure we're all runnng businesses that support our lives and passions in intangible ways too. I could keep going on and on. GTN is a group of professionals that's rare in any industry, and I'm proud and grateful to be among them.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI joined GTN in June 2020 after coming from another host agency. At the time, I was fairly new to the industry and quickly realized how much I still had to learn—especially as I navigated the challenges of planning travel during COVID. Enrolling in GTN’s TMBA program was, without question, the best decision I could have made. It gave me the foundation I needed for success, offering support on every level: business setup, branding, partner relations, legal compliance, marketing, and invaluable mentor calls. Just as importantly, it connected me with relationships and colleague collaborations that I didn’t expect to discover.\nPeople often say you go to Africa for the animals but return for the people. For me, I came to GTN for the education and support, but I stayed because of the community. The staff and colleagues I’ve met through GTN have become the most incredible enhancement to my business, offering expertise, encouragement, and perspective I didn’t know I needed. Whether it’s destination knowledge, supplier recommendations (along with personal introductions), or guidance on hiring a team and scaling my business, this community has consistently gone above and beyond.\nI started out as a solopreneur, satisfied with working independently, but GTN has encouraged me to dream bigger—to build a team and elevate my business beyond anything I imagined. The expertise and camaraderie here are truly unparalleled; I am consistently supported and inspired to grow.\nFrom the partner side, the feedback is equally as positive. While GTN, like many host agencies, provides access to elite hotel programs, the difference lies in the way partners speak about GTN’s reputation and influence. Time and again, I am reminded that being aligned with this community gives me a professional edge.\nTo say I am grateful for my GTN family is an understatement. Jen, Meredith, Sandy, Hannah, Shannon, Kristin & Lisa...along with an incredible array of staff and mentors—are present and engaged every time guidance is needed. Their efforts have directly shaped my growth and continue to fuel my success as a Million Dollar Advisor.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nGifted Travel Network\nThank you so much for sharing your experience and for being part of the GTN community since 2020. We’re so glad you found your home here after transitioning from another host agency, especially during such a challenging time in the industry. It means a lot to hear how the Travel MBA program helped you build your business from the ground up!\nWe love the way you described coming for the education but staying for the community — that’s exactly what we hope every advisor feels. Watching you grow from a solopreneur to a Million Dollar Advisor has been incredible. Your success and collaboration within our network make GTN stronger for everyone.\nWendy Crawley\nI've been a part of Gifted Travel Network (GTN) since Oct 2018 and I can honestly say it's been a game-changer for my luxury travel business. From the moment I joined, I knew I was in good hands. The team at GTN is passionate, supportive, and truly dedicated to helping their advisors succeed.\nOne of the things that sets GTN apart is their focus on entrepreneurial mentorship. Their Travel MBA program is top-notch, and it's helped me develop the skills and confidence I need to build a successful business. The program covers everything from branding and marketing to sales strategy and mindset coaching - it's a comprehensive approach that's helped me take my business to the next level.\nI also love the sense of community at GTN. The other advisors are like a family, and we all support and encourage each other to succeed. The GTN team is always available to answer questions and provide guidance, and they're constantly looking for ways to improve and expand their offerings.\nOf course, one of the biggest benefits of being a GTN advisor is the access to elite luxury travel partners. The perks and benefits we can offer our clients are unparalleled, and it's a major selling point that helps us stand out from the competition. From VIP treatment at top hotels to exclusive cruise amenities, our clients receive the best of the best - and it's all thanks to GTN's incredible partnerships.\nBut what really sets GTN apart is the in-depth training and partner training they provide. I've had the opportunity to learn from the best in the industry, and I've gained a deep understanding of the luxury travel market and how to effectively sell to high-end clients. The partner training is also top-notch, and I've had the chance to meet with partners face-to-face, which has helped me build strong relationships and stay current on the latest offerings and trends.\nOverall, I'm so grateful to be a part of the GTN community. If you're looking for a host agency that will support and empower you to build a successful luxury travel business, look no further. GTN is the real deal, and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to take their business to the next level.\nPros: \nComprehensive Travel MBA program \nSupportive community of advisors \nElite luxury travel partnerships \nUnparalleled perks and benefits for clients \nIn-depth training on luxury travel sales and marketing \nPartner training and education to help advisors stay current on the latest offerings and trends \nChance to meet partners face-to-face, building strong relationships and staying current on industry developments \nPassionate and dedicated team\nCons: None!\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful.

It's wonderful to hear that our luxury focus and training programs aligned perfectly with your own evolving clientele and business goals. \nJoining Gifted Travel Network was one of the best decisions I made when launching my travel business. Just over three years ago, I started in their 12-month Travel MBA (TMBA) program, which gave me the foundational tools and confidence I needed to hit the ground running as a luxury travel advisor.\nFast forward to today, and I’m proud to say my business continues to grow year over year, thanks to the unwavering support, leadership, and community GTN provides. The sense of connection within this network is truly special. So much so, I was honored to be asked to serve as a mentor for current TMBA students, a role that brings me so much joy. Giving back to new-to-industry advisors not only fuels my passion, but reminds me that we’re all still growing and learning in this ever-evolving space.\nWhether you're just starting out or an experienced advisor looking for the right host to elevate your business, I wholeheartedly recommend GTN. The support, preferred partner relationships, and Virtuoso affiliation allow me to truly shine in the luxury travel space and deliver incredible experiences for my clients.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "PTN Travel Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nThank you for taking the time to share your experience with PTN. I’m truly sorry to hear that your journey with us didn’t meet your expectations. We value all feedback, as it helps us refine our processes and improve the support we provide.\nI’m glad you felt welcomed during the discovery call and appreciated the personal onboarding experience. Our goal is always to ensure our advisors feel supported, especially in the early stages of their business. That said, I understand that every advisor’s needs are different, and it seems we may have missed the mark in a few areas.\nRegarding our systems, I’d like to clarify that Travefy is currently a lite CRM, but it is actively working on expanding its capabilities to become a full CRM solution. While our agent portal is a true portal, our supplier list is hosted on Google Sheets to allow for real-time updates. As a growing agency, we frequently add new suppliers, and this tool helps us keep the process streamlined and up-to-date.\nWe do encourage booking with Virtuoso suppliers as they provide our advisors with the luxury perks and benefits that come with our network. This is part of the value that PTN offers as a luxury agency, and it’s why many of our members choose to work with us. However, we also understand that some advisors may seek flexibility, and we are always open to discussing options outside our preferred suppliers list.\nOur orientation sessions are intended to provide a light introduction to all areas of our business and are followed by in-depth coaching and training multiple times per week. These sessions are designed to be actionable and specific, and I’m sorry to hear that you felt they were too generic. We aim to offer meaningful, personalized guidance to help you grow your business.\nWe also have a variety of workflows and templates available on our agent portal, and our coaching staff is always ready to assist. Our support system is designed to ensure advisors can easily reach out via support tickets or schedule one-on-one calls. Our leadership team works full-time for PTN and, as active travel advisors themselves, they are fully equipped to assist our advisors.\nRegarding the onboarding requirements, we ask new advisors to form an LLC and secure E&O insurance, as these are essential for protecting both the advisor and PTN. These requirements are discussed upfront during the discovery call.\nLastly, we use Sion as our commission tracking software, which is one of the best tools in the industry for managing commissions. As independent contractors, our advisors are responsible for taking the initiative to attend coaching and training sessions and integrating these learnings into their business. We offer a supportive environment, but the drive for success ultimately comes from the individual.\nWe wish you nothing but the best in your journey as a travel advisor."

From the start, NTG has been reliable and responsive, always ready to answer my many questions—and trust me, I’ve had plenty!\nStarting your own travel business and working with a host agency can sometimes feel isolating, no matter which one you choose. But what sets Nexion apart is the strong sense of community they cultivate. I made the effort to get involved—whether through their online messaging boards, webinars, coaching sessions, or attending their events like regional meetings and CoNexion—and it has paid off immensely. Because of this, Nexion doesn’t just feel like a business partner; it feels like a close-knit travel family I look forward to seeing every few months.\nThe resources they provide and their incredible Immersive Journey programs have been game-changers for my business (went on my first cruise by doing this - so awesome!).

  "text": "Outside Agents Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nLet me start this off by saying that I think Outside Agents is a great company for someone breaking into the industry. They provide a good path to get you started, basic business training, etc. They are a family run business which is extremely important, but may also be to their detriment which I will get into later. Most people at Outside Agents genuinely care about you and your success and you can tell that in the pride that they have for the company. Obviously in giving a three star review, you can assume there may have been some negatives, which I will get into now.\nFirstly, there is a gentleman that works for Outside Agents who while is extremely knowledgeable about the industry and the company, and has a good relationship with SOME agents, his demeanor and interaction with others is extremely unprofessional. I notice it almost daily on the Facebook group and within the message boards where he will lambaste agents for asking the wrong thing and the answer for mostly everything is refer to the LMS or why didn't you take the training. In one interaction, he explicitly called my advice wrong and said I should not be posting. As a representative of a company that both takes a monthly fee and part of your commission, he should be a steward for the agents and act in a professional and customer service-oriented manner. I can tell you without hesitation that he is the main reason I am moving away from Outside Agents this year.\nSecondly, while the one owner focuses a lot in AI and innovation, the technology behind the company is sorely lacking. The CRM looks like something from the mid to late 2000's. It works for some and others it does not. If you bring up it doesn't work for you the answer is to do the training. The provided websites are basic at best and lack any advanced feature sets. They also all are the same Wordpress template which can be detrimental to SEO rankings. Their in person trainings have no virtual option for those that work for a living. When asked the answer was \"we tried it once and it didn't work\". Fair enough, but every company on the planet has some sort of virtual piece to them. Every training that I pay for for my day job is virtual and it works extremely well. I'm not saying go all virtual, but have the option at least for those that cannot spend the money to go. For a company that is centered around innovation, the lack of any sort of input from their IC's is troublesome. They are family owned, which gives them the latitude to do as they please without input, which as I mentioned may be to their detriment. \nIn conclusion, Outside Agents will work for many and will not be the right fit for some. I am part of the \"some\" and will be moving away this year. I wrote this review to be open and honest, and to show that while a company can be 5 stars in certain areas, it could use improvement for others."

  "text": "Uniglobe Travel Center Host Reviews\nI have been with Uniglobe for almost two years, after a long career in healthcare, and I can honestly say that joining this network has been one of the best decisions of my professional life. From my very first conversation with April, the Director of Sales and Marketing, I knew I had found my new home as a travel entrepreneur.\nUniglobe has provided me with unwavering support at every turn—not only from the management team but also from my fellow travel advisors, who have become an integral part of my journey. The community here is truly one of a kind: a cohesive, friendly group of like-minded business owners who are kind, accepting, and always willing to lend a helping hand. Unlike other agencies I’ve encountered, where many advisors are more hobbyists than serious businesspeople, Uniglobe is filled with professionals who share the same commitment to excellence. We all strive to provide top-tier service to our clients while supporting each other in every way possible.\nThe resources and guidance offered by Uniglobe are second to none. Our private, active social media group is an invaluable tool, and I’ve never asked a question without receiving an immediate, helpful response. The management team is equally responsive and proactive, always available to assist with any issue that arises.\nThanks to Uniglobe's constant support, my business has grown rapidly, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without the backing of this amazing network. Recently, I brought on my first independent contractor, and the process was seamless—thanks to the support from Uniglobe management, my fellow advisors, and the legal team they recommended.\nIf you’re looking for a professional, supportive, and growth-oriented travel community, I can’t recommend Uniglobe highly enough."

  "text": "WorldVia Travel Network Host Reviews\nI decided to join WorldVia after checking out several host agencies, and honestly… it’s been the best move I’ve made so far. 🙌\nCommunity and vibes are super important to me. I’m a huge vibe person, and from the start, WorldVia just felt right. They offer tons of training and in-person events, and I’m already signed up for their annual conference in September. And get this...it was under $1,000! 🤑 That felt like such a win, especially after paying $1,499 (plus hotel and air) for a previous host conference that didn’t feel all that valuable beyond the cruise itself.\nI chose to start with their $9/month plan at 70% commission and paid a one-time $99 setup fee. It felt like a really smart move since I don’t have steady bookings just yet, and I can upgrade anytime. Compared to what I paid to start with my last host — $1,373 between the startup fee, required Virtuoso course, and monthly dues — this felt way more reasonable and flexible.\nThe onboarding was smooth, and the support has blown me away. During the week, there’s live chat, and you can actually call and talk to a real person. 📞 They also have an entire air ticketing team, which is a big deal for me. From what I’ve seen in the community, they jump in fast when flight issues pop up and help rearrange things without you feeling like you’re on your own.\nOne of my biggest concerns leaving Virtuoso was losing access to exclusives. Totally not an issue. WorldVia partners with Travel Leaders Network (TLN), and they’re part of TLN’s President’s Circle — so there are plenty of offers, FAMs, and tools. Honestly, TLN gives you a lot more to work with, especially when you’re just getting started. I’ve already found more training, leads, and resources through TLN than I ever had before.\nAnd I want to mention something personal. As a gay advisor, it was important to me to feel welcome. 🏳️‍🌈 During my interview, I brought it up — and Jamie (who is amazing by the way) told me that they’re super supportive and that their Chief Revenue Officer is openly gay. That stuck with me. They don’t have a formal LGBTQ+ advisor community right now, but they said they’d be open to building one if there’s interest or even helping me create one. I felt seen and respected, which really mattered.\nI was a little nervous that a bigger host might make me feel like a small fish in a big pond. But I haven’t felt that at all. Everyone I’ve talked to has been kind, responsive, and genuinely excited to help. I don’t feel like I’m bothering anyone when I reach out — I feel like I’m part of something.\nIf you’re looking for a host that’s supportive, affordable, welcoming, and full of real humans who actually care, WorldVia deserves a serious look. 💫 I feel motivated, aligned, and finally at home."

I truly don’t think I could every work for another host agency. \n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWhen you join Departure Lounge you become a business partner with Keith Waldon and his expanding travel advisor team. Keith, by nature of who he is, has created a work culture of innovation and empowerment. Keith generously offers his creative business sense and connections to enable each of his ICs to help attain their business goals and aspirations. In my 20 years of working with Keith, the last six as a part of the Departure Lounge team, I have observed him go out of his way, utilize his creative gifts, skills and contacts to help make those around him a success. There is no other place I would work.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nAfter being with a different host agency for 3 years we made the move to Departure Lounge in September of 2019 and just had our 1 year anniversary. The change has been the best thing we have done for our business! Keith has built a team of advisors that are top notch and created an environment of collaboration and cooperation rather than competition - all of the advisors are always so helpful and willing to share their knowledge and areas of expertise. The Departure Lounge back office staff is likewise just as helpful and does a top notch job. Keith is constantly innovating aspects of the business from creating marketing tools for us to use, holding retreats, developing VIP supplier programs, etc. His reputation and standing in the travel industry is second to none and he is always available to help with anything we might need. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about our experience with Departure Lounge as our host agency. \n1\n1\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI just joined Departure Lounge two weeks ago (during a pandemic) and can't say enough good things about Keith, the support staff and all of the advisors! There is a true spirit of camaraderie and helpfulness among the advisors and a family feel to the company. Even before signing, Keith gave me good advice on branding and positioning issues and has been responsive to my questions after joining. I feel my fellow advisors view me not as a competitor, but as a colleague and they are quick to suggest appropriate resources when I need help. All in all it has been a wonderful experience! \n2\n2\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nIntegrity, ingenuity, camaraderie, creativity…. The majority of my career was in nature conservation, so when I decided to become a travel advisor, it was critical to me to find a team of smart and creative colleagues who above all exhibit impeccable integrity. Departure Lounge delivers in all these categories, with the atmosphere being set at the top by owner and founder Keith Waldon. Although he is busy and serves on many boards and committees, he always has time to answer questions, think of creative new partnerships and approaches, and help make amazing connections. I looked at every single agency listed on HAR and Departure Lounge quickly came to the top for me given its willingness to innovate, the strong sense of camaraderie (even with advisors across the continent and in other countries), an excellent reputation within the industry, a very fair commission structure, and the wonderful connections. \n3\n1\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nMimi, Tisha and I are so proud to be part of such an amazing team! We knew we had found something special the first time we spoke to Keith Waldon. It was an easy decision to join his team. We are so grateful for the support, resources and reputation that come along with being part of Departure Lounge. We work with an wonderful group of people. Our whole team works together and is so helpful to one another and Keith's knowledge and leadership are invaluable. We feel so lucky to be here and wouldn't want to be anywhere else! \nJen Gouk, Mimi Sternberg and Tisha Patt\n3\n2\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI spent months interviewing and considering Host Agency candidates, looking for that right fit. Departure Lounge was my ultimate choice for several reasons, including an innovative approach to doing business in the 21st century, creative & strategic partnerships, a strong sense of collaboration, and the invaluable support & guidance of Keith Waldon. The diverse collection of backgrounds and niche interests among the advisors at Departure Lounge ensures we have a well-rounded source of information and the culture is positive, feels more like a team. Those who are self-starters, motivated, and quick learners do well at Departure Lounge.\n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nAfter countless hours of research and interviews with other agencies and their advisors, we kept coming back to DL. We feel so fortunate to have found our home with a host agency that has an impeccable reputation in the industry, has built incredible preferred partnerships, is always innovating and has the most engaged community of supportive advisors. We feel that the spirit of 'community over competition' is so prevalent, and is in no small feat a testament to the amazing leadership we have in Keith and the kind, intelligent, hard working advisors he has attracted to our team!\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nHaving started with another agency originally, I can say with complete certainty that Departure Lounge is amazing- the support and database, along with a carefully built team that is intelligent and so fantastic is priceless. That combined with Keith’s connections and experience in the industry make Departure Lounge quite the powerhouse I’m proud to have backing us. \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nDeparture Lounge is an agency full of people that care, people that operate with integrity, and people that believe in community. This isn’t by chance, Keith Waldon, our agency owner, has built a team that reflects the values that matter to him in. His reputation and innovation in this industry is unmatched and he truly cares about all of us. He makes himself available for his team and this applies to all of our colleagues as well. They are so giving of knowledge and experience and this makes us all better as advisors. The back office staff is amazing and so helpful as well. Being a part of an agency with the reputation Departure Lounge has been such a great experience, a culture of building each other up and helping each other at the forefront. \n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "Magical Moments Vacations Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nBefore I decided on a career change, I did a lot of research into where I wanted to begin my next step. I was extremely impressed with what Magical Moments Vacations offered in both training and commissions. The agency has provided so much support from throughout the training process. I am please with my decision to join MMV.\nLinda O'Brien\nI chose MMV because I wanted real support and training, and I’ve gotten exactly that and more. The Academy Program made everything easy to understand and actually gave me the confidence to get started. \nThe MMV team has been amazing to work with so far. Everyone has been welcoming, patient, and genuinely invested in helping me grow. Anytime I’ve had a question or needed guidance, someone was right there to help. It’s rare to find a team that feels this supportive. \nWorking with agency management has also been great. They’re organized, encouraging, and really know how to motivate without pressure. \nOverall, I’m really grateful I chose MMV. The training, leadership, and the people behind it all have made this such a positive experience already. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI researched and interviewed with several host agencies, and I am confident that joining MMV was the best decision for me. I knew that there was a fit with the well-outlined process for new agent selection right on their website. This made the process seamless, and I appreciated the transparency. After two years working with MMV, I can say that the Management Team is truly committed to and invests training new agents. They also provide ample opportunity for experienced agents to continue their professional development. \nThe Academy experience far exceeded my expectations. MMV Leadership has built something very special here, and I am thrilled to be a part of this team.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI absolutely love working with Magical Moments Vacations. I appreciated the fact that they had an in depth application form and interview. They cared just as much about who they bring on to the team as I cared about what team I join. The prep and orientation has been incredibly helpful and clear and I love the facebook pages to use as a resource and to reach out for experienced help. I am very happy with my experience so far. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI am just finishing the Academy as a Travel Expert!! This has been an amazing journey so far and I'm just getting started! The training is easy to follow, very thourough, and the administrative staff is so helpful and prompt. I decided to join in after using a friend of mine a few times as an agent. She did such a great job helping myself and family plan trips, and I wanted to do the same for others. Although we will now work for the same company, we will be able to work together and support one another in our MMV family. I have my first client trip booked and will receive my first commision check in 2026! The first of many and looking forward to making more than other agents with other agencies. Can't wait to fill my calendar with client trips!! \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI am currently a new travel agent who is almost through the full academy training. I have really enjoyed learning all the aspects about being a travel agent and would highly recommend MMV for their extensive training program. I enjoyed connecting with other new agents and having access to management and senior travel advisors while working through my academy lessons.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI did a lot of research before deciding which travel agency I wanted to join, and Magical Moments Vacations was always a standout for me. I had used one of their agents in the past to help plan my Walt Disney World vacation, and they were beyond helpful, kind, and full of great tips. They made my trip feel so special and made me feel like I was their top priority. \nWhen I decided to take the leap and become a travel advisor myself, I reached back out to that same agent and asked a ton of questions. He never once discouraged me. Instead, he was incredibly supportive and encouraging. I had spoken with other agencies before, and none of them came close to the warmth and positivity I found at Magical Moments Vacations. \nAfter my interview, I knew I had found my home agency. Everyone has been so welcoming, helpful, and always willing to go above and beyond whenever I have a question. The training program was fantastic, easy to follow, and full of real-world examples that gave me the confidence I needed to start my business successfully. \nThe management team is amazing too. I love the monthly Zoom calls where we can ask questions, share wins, and get encouragement to keep growing. I am so happy with my decision to join the Magical Moments Vacations family and I cannot wait for all the fun journeys and adventures ahead.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nJoining Magical Moments Vacations has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. From day one, I knew this wasn't just another company- it's a family of passionate travelers who truly love what they do. Everyone at MMV shares the same mission: to make travel planning easy, exciting and personal. That energy is contagious, and it's what makes this agency so special. The support, training and encouragement that comes from being a part of this team has made me a better agent.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI have absolutely been loving my time with Magical Moments Vacations! Throughout every step of my Academy training I've felt so supported and never felt alone. Everyone from Agency management to other academy students have been right there by my side answering any questions I had. Everyone I have met in the agency has been so kind and energetic. Every interaction makes me more and more sure that I chose the right agency to work with!! \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI started with Magical Moments Vacations a couple of months ago after a friend referred me to them and have learned so much already!! They have been so incredibly supportive from the start! Their training program is very in depth and does a great job a going through the big companies you book with. By the end of the program I feel pretty confident with quoting a client and answering questions they have. If I have any questions pop up they are quick to answer and very very helpful so that my client gets the best trip! No regrets! \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nMMV is honestly a family. Support and dedication by all of our amazing agents is more than anyone could ask for. Our MMV family works together to make us the BEST agency with the highest honors. Our success belong to all of us. MMV Teamwork is AMAZING. From our MMV academy to our Marketing and Agency support.

Did you?\nI joined Modern Travel Professionals as a new agent. I felt supported by the agency and was provided plenty of training on both agency expectations as well as destinations. The opportunities for continued education and FAMs has been plentiful. Commission split is very fair and payments are sent in a timely manner . I cannot say enough about the continued support I receive from this agency.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nChristine Hardenberger\nWe love having you as part of the MTP family! I can't believe how quickly you've grown your business. You are a rock star!\nThe support provided by the team at Modern Travel Professionals is -- in my experience -- outstanding. Commissions are paid on time, training is provided, and FAMs are available. The agency provides tools like TESS as well as training on how to maximize those tools. The other agents are amazing colleagues - someone has been everywhere so there's always a resource to assist. \n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nIn this business, we hear host agency stories from each other. Many pay low commissions and have no support or training. Modern Travel Professionals is not one of those agencies. At Modern Travel Professionals you will find more than fair commission splits, timely payments, support like no other, FAM trips every year, goal setting with help to reach that goal and great ongoing training. This is the best host agency out there. Christine is doing it right!\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI moved to MTP in April 2022. I love having a CRM (previous agency didn't have one), training on the CRM, training on various topics such as social media, how to qualify a client, and more. I love opportunities to travel with the agency twice a year on FAM trips organized by our owner, Christine. She is ALWAYS on hand to offer great advice when I'm in a bind or unfamiliar with a destination. Christine is supportive, listens well & genuinely cares about what our CLIENT wants, rather than earning the most money. She is a true leader of our agency and sets a valuable example. Commission splits are very fair, as are annual fees. I highly recommend MTP and am thrilled to have found a home after 8 years in the business.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI joined Modern Travel Professionals in 2015 and it was the best decision I've made to grow my business. I've learned so much about marketing my business with Modern Travel Professionals. Support is always there when I need it, and I feel as though I could contact any of the agents at MTP, and they would help me with whatever I needed. I left an agency that didn't pay commissions timely (or at all) and I've never had that problem with Modern Travel Professionals. Everything is above board here, and I love working with this amazing team of agents. From first-hand experience, training and support, I have the tools to grow my business even more than I already have.\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nModern Travel Professionals has provided the training, first-hand experience, industry tools, and overall support to assist me in my travel career. I feel comfortable asking questions and seeking assistance when I need it, and I always have a team of fellow agents and other support able to assist when I need guidance. \n3\n1\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nBetsy Walker\nI joined Modern Travel Professionals in 2022. Wanting to expand my sales beyond Orlando theme park vacations, I have found that Modern Travel Professionals provides training, support and opportunities to grow my business. I've set goals to achieve and find that it drives me to excel. My business has increased in the past year and I am looking forward to being even more successful in 2023 and beyond.\n3\n1\n3 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "Million Miles Travel Agency Host Reviews\nMillion Miles Travel was my host agency and I have leveraged Tammy's support of group travels, using WeTravel. Tammy is a lawyer so I want to be careful that I do not make any claims that are not completely factual.\nShort story: \nMy clients made their full payment through WeTravel (where it went into an escrow account solely controlled by Tammy), with the expectation that money would be paid to the operator. Instead Tammy took the money out of the account (less $0.20) and did NOT pay the operator. \nTammy has not responded to emails/messages/calls for 6 weeks.\nI cannot refund the customers without Tammy returning the money to WeTravel. The operator can't run a trip without being paid, and the customers can't get their money back.\nThe only way the trip can happen at this point is if I pay for the trip myself for my clients, or my clients pay twice, through no fault of their own or the operator.\nLonger version: \n- My clients paid in full in February 2025 (for a trip in May 2025) via WeTravel, which means the money was in the WeTravel account owned/controlled by Tammy. \n- Tammy was supposed to pay the deposit in early March and communicated with me and the operator about it (but did *not* complete the deposit payment) \n- On March 12 she stopped responding to all texts, voicemails, emails, FB messages. \n- On March 31, she sent a BCC'd email saying she'd been in an accident but would get to all priority items even though she had limited connectivity \n- I continued to message on all channels to get her to pay the operator for the deposit+full amount due for the trip (or allow me access to the funds); no response \n- On April 11, I tried to refund the customers via weTravel, but discovered there was only 20 cents in the escrow account... so she had NOT paid the operator, but took all the funds out (less 20 cents) \n- I cannot refund the customers. I messaged/called asking her to replace my clients' funds many times. Again, no response. \n- Radio silence. It's been another 11 days, with no response.\nTammy has possession of my clients' money, hasn't paid the operator, and I can't refund them (for a trip that was supposed to start in less than one month now).\nThis has been my worst travel agent's nightmare: If I want my customer's trip to still happen, I have to pay out of my own pocket, while Tammy has my clients' money in her own pocket. \nI would not recommend working with Tammy for situations where she is the blocker for getting money to your suppliers. There is no redundancy. If she goes dark, is sick, gets into an accident, etc, there is no backup or way for you to get help. Your money is with Tammy and you have no access to it, which makes it impossible to run a travel agency. \nI have also reported this situation to the California Department of Justice (the clients are from California and Million Miles Travel has a SOT license for CA) as well as the Brooklyn District Attorney -- since holding client's money without paying for their trip or without refunding them if it is canceled for lack of operator payment, seems antithetical to good business practices.\nIf anyone does have open communication lines with Tammy, I would really appreciate it if you could kindly ask her to return my customer's money to weTravel so they can be refunded. I have been advised to \"lawyer up\" to try to get my client's money back since Tammy isn't responding to me -- but I would very much love love LOVE to avoid that pathway if she could just return the money."

I chose TPI for a few reasons over a few other agencies...the main reason was the support that was apparant. As a new agent, I'm overwhelmed. Still. Yet, I feel the support and the understanding from everyone, to get me on track to making sales. \nThe CRM system will be amazing once I get it up and running. I can't wait to update this review in 2 months. I feel I haven't touched the surface on what I can do with TPI as my support. Go ROCKSTARS\n10\n2\n10 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have found my home at TPI! I was with another host agency before and I can say WOW what a difference in their teachings in philosophy of owning and running a profitable travel agency. TPI gives you outstanding support and education on how to own a successful travel agency. You never feel like you are competing against your host agency because they never put their name in front of the consumer. TPI is also a member owner of Signature which brings its own set of incredible opportunities. Signature offers additional training, technology and top contracts with suppliers. TPI and Signature is a winning combination for me. \n10\n3\n10 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI switched to TPI almost six months ago and have very positive experiences to report so far. Their marketing and supplier relations VPs are very active in helping and educating agents. A+. I had an issue that the accounting folks had to track down, also a positive, professionally handled experience. Their weekly webinars are consistently informative, idea-generating, and fun. The agent support staff are responsive and helpful; I had a lot of suppliers to juggle in switching over, and Alex and Corey were a big help with that. I feel (and find IRL) that I'm supported by the staff at TPI. It's too early to make a definitive assessment, but so far, I'm very glad I switched my host agency to TPI.\n10\n2\n10 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nTravel Planners continues to support us as Travel Advisors to bring our businesses to the next level. The education and support this company gives is second to none. Not only do they help us with our business, they care about us as people - we are part of the TPI Family. I also appreciate the fact that I can run my business the way I want to - do you want to work part time, that is great - do you want to work full time and have this be your primary income?

Lauderdale on Travel Convention back 2015 to looking for info on how to become a travel agent. When I stopped at there both. They told me they were in Orlando and I Laughed because I live in Orlando. haha It was a wrap for me. Travel Planners International is a fun group as well. FUN FUN FUN Iris Nater Padro, TPI Travel Advisor \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSupport for a season such as this!! I'll try to make this a reasonable length and say 100% I recommend TPI as a Host Agency. Prior to 2020 this recommendation would have still been positive, but now early 2021, I cannot express the way I have felt supported as an independent home based advisor. Being kept up to date, the advances in systems and procedures in the midst of global, company and industry loss, the live and personal education and connection, etc etc. It has been incredible. You reach out - you get a response. You have fears or concerns - they are met and addressed. Events are educational and fun and will be filled with emotion on returning to live events. Their relationships with suppliers has us as Advisors as a main consideration. The fellow advisor support is friendly, offering and sharing. I know there are a lot of options out there and I explored all of them and I have followed up on them throughout the pandemic - I made the \"best\" choice. TPI is a family...\n7\n0\n7 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI switched to TPI in the middle of COVID and even though I haven't yet made a single penny, my business is already 100 stronger than it was with my previous host. TPI's support and continuous motion forward has been incredible! Always someone available to answer my questions. The private FB group is a fantastic resource. The back end website is amazing and full of tools and information to really make you...well....a ROCK STAR!!!!!\n5\n2\n5 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "Dream Vacations Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nPeople tell me almost daily that they’re so jealous of me. Why? Because I have the coolest job on the planet! What could be more exciting than traveling to fabulous places? I spend every day helping people plan trips to amazing places all over the world. Friends and strangers have told me that I light up when I talk about my business. This is my tenth year in business, and I still love going to work every day. \nI did a lot of research before choosing CruiseOne. I spoke with many agents from several different companies. I ended up choosing CruiseOne for several reasons. Their technology was superior to the competition, which was very important to me. CruiseOne agents were willing and eager to answer all of my questions (and now I do the same when I get calls from people interested in a franchise). And I liked the person that I was working with at CruiseOne. He was patient, answering all of my questions honestly. He didn’t pressure me to make a decision. Other companies I called used a more high-pressure approach, calling constantly and pressuring me. For all of these reasons, I knew CruiseOne was the right company for me. \nI have never regretted my decision to start this business. Our headquarters staff are a pretty amazing team! But here’s what I love most about CruiseOne. We are all a team, headquarters and agents. We don’t see each other as competition. We all help each other, and cheer each other on. I’ve learned so much over the years and continue to learn from my fellow franchisees. And I pass along as much knowledge as I can. I am proud to be a part of this great family. \n- Darci Upham, Franchise Owner since 2006, Hampstead, NC\nDarci Upham\nDream Vacations genuinely wants ALL of their franchisees to succeed!\nWe were struck during our first National Conference of the genuineness and the passion with which DV helps develop their network by providing limitless tools for learning and growth. \nAny time we encounter an issue we can't research and solve on our own, Support Services, or any of the other support departments respond quickly with helpful suggestions.\n3\n2\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI started by franchise in 2011 and have never looked back. I appreciate the amazing support that Dream Vacations provides its franchisees. When I started I didn't have a single customer. The lead programs, marketing, support and training helped me to become a million-dollar plus agency. I love that I can run my franchise pretty much the way I want - I have a storefront with independent agents and employee agents. But the most important thing is that while I am in business for myself, I'm not in business by myself. I have a wonderful network of support, not just from our home office/franchisor, but from a network of thousands of other Dream Vacations owners and agents, who are like family. We help one another to succeed by sharing our knowledge and time with others. It's a recipe for success. I love what I do and I love the Dream Vacations brand. \nI would like to add that the last 2+ years dealing with COVID were extremely tough - but I have to say our franchise provided us with much-needed support, encouragement, and hope. The franchise implemented programs to help us in many ways, even financial. Dream Vacations is definitely interested in my success.\nI highly recommend Dream Vacations to anyone who loves travel, has an entrepreneurial spirit, and is not afraid to work hard for what they want. \n4\n1\n4 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWe've been a part of the World Travel Holdings' home-based cruise division for over 16 years, and we recently made the decision to become Dream Vacations franchisees. The HQ support is fantastic! They are \"REAL\" people that you can call and have a conversation with. They care about the entire network and want each franchise to experience their own version of success. We have many fantastic marketing programs, exclusive supplier offers, award-winning technology, a responsive support team and more...all making us look good to our clients!! So happy to be a part of this family!\n7\n1\n7 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nRay and I have been with Dream Vacations since its inception, having been CruiseOne since 2011. We truly are happy with our decision. We love promoting travel and guiding our guests to the best vacation choices for them. The support and encouragement and training we receive from the Dream Vacation support team from our Senior Vice President Deb flows down to all the staff. They back us 100% and listen to us. They really care about us personally, and our success business-wise. \nThis is the best decision we could have made both personally, because we have really enjoyed the travel and the comradery with the staff and other agents, and our success with our clients. \n3\n4\n3 people found this review helpful.

Did you?\nWe are continually amazed by the amount of ongoing support we receive from our CruiseOne / Dream Vacations franchisor. We owned a franchise in a different industry for 12 years and were pretty much on our own to come up promotions, marketing collateral, email blasts, etc. so we truly know the difference and greatly appreciate all of the help and resources we receive from our franchisor and the entire headquarters team!

Did you?\nWould I purchase my CruiseOne franchise all over again? Hands down, absolutely! No question about it. There are so many resources available at HQ to help me when I need it. Support Services is absolutely amazing, and they have gone above and beyond for my so many times! The Marketing department has given me their creative guidance and have been generous in sharing just what has worked for other franchisees. My Business Development Representative (Adam Taylor) has been my sounding board when I needed it most. PR has consistently given me the tools to promote my business and have alerted me to opportunities that fit my niche markets. I’m super excited about World Travel Holdings’ commitment to technology and all of the great tools they give us in the field to be successful. It’s clear that HQ wants us all to be successful. I’m looking forward to many years as a CruiseOne franchise owner, and building a successful business as part of a world-class organization!\n26\n2\n26 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nOwning a CruiseOne travel franchise affords me the flexibility to set my own hours to revolve around my class schedule, and will give me real-world experience when I start pursuing my business degree next year at the University of Houston. I think being a younger owner will offer my clients a fresh perspective on vacations for a younger crowd and multi-generational groups. My parents are entrepreneurs and along with my business teacher, they encouraged me to pursue my dreams. I didn’t think I was going to get this far, but when I began researching business ideas and came across CruiseOne, everything clicked into place. It fit my personal love for travel, and by budget.\n18\n2\n18 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI first learned about CruiseOne from another CruiseOne Franchisee that I met on a ship. I picked her brain probably to the point of annoyance and once back stateside I started to research various franchises and CruiseOne by far had very positive owner reviews about support, systems, etc. I was and still am a district manager for restaurant chain. Prior to working in the corporate world I owned two restaurants. I am at the point now where I am busy enough to do this full time if needed or continue to bring on associates to handle the extra business. Let’s face it, it can be a 7 day a week job but I love it so that makes it enjoyable. You have got to love what you do first and foremost. But knowledge is the key to success in this business; It gives you confidence to answer any of your clients questions. I have been up double digits each year of business but am having by far the best year so far this year (2015) up over 80%. CruiseOne is a great organization that continues to move forward and evolve the tools that we are using. The support staff, if needed, is great and very responsive. Being part of World Travel Holdings provides lots of pricing advantages and influence with our travel partners. I have lots of loyal clients that either were already friends or have become friends that love to travel often. Our working relationship is so close that 4 of them often just text me the ship and sail date to book in one sentence and it is done. It has become a running joke that has actually spread that practice onto others doing it as well.\n27\n2\n27 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

  "text": "Dream Vacations Advisor Host Reviews\nDream Vacations has been an excellent hybrid option for me. I work full-time, but love travel. Having lived overseas and been to almost 50 countries, the allure of being an agent was too great! I wanted access to better prices for travel, and to get paid for all the travel I was already booking for people. \nThe training was simple, and I was off to the races. So far I have booked 16 trips since last summer, all of them land bookings. It has been an absolute blast and my franchise owner is a rockstar. \nA couple of notes. 1. don't think you will get rich doing this. Most vacations outside of cruises and all-inclusive pay very little. Which is ok, but I don't think I fully understood it. 2. Dream Vacations takes royalties, then your franchise takes some (obviously) and then you get the leftover. Again, this makes sense, but I didn't fully understand how much they would take. On some of the smaller bookings where you only make $100 in commission, that doesn't leave a whole lot left over for you. Just something to be aware of. 3. Dream Vacations values cruises over all else. Many of the suppliers I work with my amazing Franchise owner helped me with as Dream vacations did very little with them. Many times we have had to go to the drawing board on things to figure out how to make it work as most training is only about cruises. My strong suit is land travel as that is what I have done the most of, so that is what I sell. It is obviously entirely possible, but something to know. Lastly, the discounts weren't as epic as I had built up in my head :) Through Dream vacations I was able to get my CLIA certification which gets me access to certain discounts, but otherwise you aren't allowed to book through most of the preferred suppliers for yourself (even if you don't make commission) and the discounts you always see people rave about aren't actually that common. Again, just something that is useful to know going into it. \nOverall, this is an incredible program with a lot of room for growth. I am now certified to sell Disney and Marriott, have the ability to help people plan a detailed trip, and am constantly gaining new knowledge. I am very grateful and will be here for many years to come! If you love travel, you love to book it, and want to make some extra money, this is a great option."

  "text": "Incentive Connection Travel Host Reviews\nA Trusted Partner for Over 19 Years - A review of Incentive Connection Travel as a Host Agency\nI have been in the travel industry for over 40 years and have spent the last 19 of those years with Incentive Connection Travel (ICT) as my host agency. Choosing ICT was one of the best decisions I made for my business. Even coming in with extensive experience-including time in storefront agencies, holding an IATAN card, being a member of ASTA, and bringing a loyal client base-I found the support and connection through IICT to be a key factor in helping my business continue to thrive.\nWhat makes ICT stand out is their dedication to growth-not just their own, but yours as an agent. From the very beginning, the owners have provided unwavering support, truly investing in my success. They offer the tools, relationships, and communication platforms that help you stay informed, educated, and connected. Despite being headquartered in Arizona, ICT supports a nationwide network of agents seamlessly. Geography is never a barrier when you're part of this community.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of being with ICT is the sense of connection. As a home-based Independent Contractor, it can be easy to feel isolated, but ICT makes sure that does not happen, if you communicate with others. Through supplier-hosted webinars, new agent helps session, and virtual training opportunities, we stay informed and inspired. The annual conferences-with face-to-face time with suppliers-are truly a great way to be noticed and add a personal dimension that makes a big difference in relationship-building and learning.\nOur Facebook group and regular supplier webinars have been a constant source of insight and advice. It's a place where agents collaborate, share experiences, and support one another. ICT has cultivated not just a host agency, but a professional family.\nICT has grown with us, and because of their continued efforts to evolve, so have I. If you're looking for a host agency that is committed to your success, provides genuine support, and fosters a strong community of agents-you will find that with Incentive Connection Travel."

  "text": "Nexion Travel Group-Canada Host Reviews\nAfter 15 years in the financial industry, I got the idea that I should be a travel agent. In all honesty, it started as a silly idea. I didn't know anything or a single person in the travel industry who could offer me any insight. I thought the only option was to go apply at a brick and mortar and I certainly didn't want to do that. When I learned about being home based, I was sold. \nResearch began for me on the internet of course. Websites such as this one and others started giving me ideas of how to open your own travel agency. I read the pros and cons of using a host or going completely independent. \nI attended Cruise3Sixty in April and decided to join Nexion Canada in May. I thought their sign-up fee and monthly fees were very reasonable unlike other hosts that require a huge start-up. I didn't have thousands of dollars to start this new business and I certainly didn't want to take that much risk in case I failed. Nexion also offers a Power Up training program, perfect for such a newbie like myself.\nNexion's Power Up program is phenomenal. They have pre-recorded sessions you can listen to at your own pace AND refer back to when you need to do something live for the first time. In addition, I really appreciated the one-on-one weekly sessions with the trainer. What was important to me and still is, is being able to reach out to Nexion when I have a question and to get a timely response. \nI chose the option to brand myself and I really like feeling like I'm the owner of my own travel agency. Nexion provides the back office support I need. I truly feel that they support me and my business and sincerely want me to succeed. It's only been a short few months and I would never have imagined that I would be where I am today if it weren't for them. \nI am looking forward to my future as a home based travel agent with Nexion."

The management and administrative staff are always available to offer the support or additional resources that we need to do our job.

At the time I vacationed to Disney destinations frequently and my friends and family always came to me to help them book their Disney vacations. As time passed I thought I would join an agency and still help those same people, but with an agency. The only thing is I worked a full time job and worked a variety of shifts. MainStreet was perfect for what I needed as they allowed the flexibility to be a Travel Agent and still hold my full-time job. \nTheir variety of training they offer as well as the many suppliers they work with have helped me grow as an agent. Something that was once a hobby has become something I am passionate about with a hunger to grow more and more each year. My portfolio has grown from just Disney to dozens of other suppliers/vendors.\nI have also attended a FAM trip and have made Elite agent, 2 years in a row! As an Elite agent, I am able to attend a retreat that consists of several days of training with different suppliers, receive one-on-one growth/marketing plans, as well as dedicated training, and opportunities to experience supplier trips! I hope to continue to grow and share my passion of traveling with others!\nTreesa Waibel\nMainStreet Travel is a super easy place to be a travel agent. There are no extra fees, you don’t have to hit any booking minimums, and you get to join fun trips that help you learn while traveling. All the training you need is there if you want it, and everyone’s really friendly! It feels like a family!

The training was always top-notch; not only did it help me sharpen my skills, it made learning fun and accessible throughout my entire journey as an advisor!\nBut it wasn’t just about the work, MainStreet made every day exciting with unforgettable FAM trips! Exploring new destinations with colleagues, sharing laughs, and building friendships made it feel less like a job and more like a big adventure. Leadership was always supportive, and team members cheered each other on from start to finish!\nWhat I will always remember is the amazing culture. Everyone cared, listened, and encouraged each other! I truly believe MainStreet Travel is the best place to start or grow a career in travel. If you want a supportive, energetic team that knows how to work hard and have fun, this agency is unbeatable!\n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI started with MainStreet Travel in 2020. I had zero experience at the time, but MainStreet’s training was honestly better than I expected! Lots of classes and information to help you learn the industry and start booking!\nMainStreet is big on community, too! There’s always something happening in their online forums, and they host site visits and fun networking events.

Here, you get straightforward advice, great training, and real support for growing a successful travel business. There’s never any feeling that you’re competing with the agency for clients, they make sure your name is always front and center, not theirs!\nMainStreet’s connections are top notch, too. They partner with great industry organizations that open doors to extra training, better tech, and some amazing deals with suppliers! The combination of MainStreet’s backing and these premium partnerships has given my agency so many new opportunities.

They make it easy to learn, ask questions, and take your business to the next level, no matter how long you’ve been doing this!\nThe support and training are incredible, there’s always something new to help you grow, and the team is quick to answer and encourage you. I never feel lost or stuck, and there’s real excitement when agents hit milestones or bring in fresh ideas. What’s cool is how approachable everyone is, including the people at the top. They treat you like a person, not just a number!\nMy business has grown faster than I ever expected because of the awesome resources, great relationships with travel suppliers, and ongoing coaching. But honestly, the best part is the vibe, it’s welcoming, upbeat, and everyone wants each other to win.

Did you?\nWhen I started with Matty K Travel I had absolutely no experience in the travel business. I'd had a long career in health care and was looking for a change. Matt welcomed me and made sure that I had the training and confidence to work on my own. Questions are answered almost immediately. Matt will go out of his way to help any of the agents that are under the Matty K/Castle Vacations brand and will offer help to those who are working with another agency but may need an arrow pointed in the right direction. In all of the time I have worked with Matt I have never seen him lose his patience or temper. I have never worried that a question might be too silly to ask. If an agent has an idea for an additional contact it is explored and if appropriate added to the lengthy list of places to explore. Matt will always stand with his agents and mitigate any issues before they become a problem . I am proud to say that I work with the wonderful people at Matty K and look forward to many years of working with the great team that Matt has built.\n0\n1\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

They are honest, supportive, timely with payments and someone always responds when you have a question. \nYou often feel like just another dollar sign to host agencies as they bring in agent after agent and can care less about claiming and confirming your hard earned hotel and car rental commissions. There are agencies that only want big dollar cruises and vacations and if you aren't bringing those in, you are on your own. Gulliver's is the exact opposite!

Our company would consistently focus on the client and provide options that came from listening to the client and discovering the purpose of the trip.

The affiliation with Lake Shore provides an outstanding network for my clients and strengthens the negotiation power we have to provide upgrades, amenities and insider experiences through the Virtuoso network for our clients. Not to mention the amazing relationships Lake Shore has with vendors throughout the globe. Since joining Lake Shore whenever I explained to a Vendor I was new to the industry and looking for some help. Multiple vendors would say, “You have joined the best team” or “Lake Shore always takes care of the advisors and their clients.” That is exactly what I wanted for my clients. \n2. The training was great and does not stop after that first week in their office. You can call or email at any time. Plus the training doesn’t just come from the training manager or your mentor.

As a new travel advisor equipped with only my passion and drive, I connected with Lake Shore Travel during my search to find the perfect host agency to partner with and launch my career. I met with the agency's Training Coordinator and the thoroughness and depth of their Mentor Program not only impressed me but gave me the insight I needed to make an informed decision regarding my future in the industry. As a top-seller of luxury travel services and a Virtuoso host agency, Lake Shore Travel, superseded all of my host agent criteria.\nLake Shore Travel's Mentor Program is best-in-class and blends industry insight and hand-ons, real-time training with the application of all the industry tools and resources you will need to be successful. As an added perk, supplier presentations are infused in the week long program to really give you a true sense of learning about the products and building key relationships. The entire team is engaged in the program and available to field questions and share their first-hand experiences. It's truly an invaluable experience.\nMy mentor and the entire family of advisors took me under their wing and have been beyond supportive and accessible, which as a home-based agent is key to my success and motivation. \nLaunching my career with Lake Shore Travel is the best decision I have ever made. I am so blessed and excited to engage with such an amazing group of people everyday!\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful.

  "text": "Largay Travel Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nI have been an ITC for Largay Travel for over 11 years. I can't imagine doing this job without a company like Largay supporting me. Their stellar reputation with suppliers and hoteliers makes my job, as well as the quality of experience my clients enjoy top-notch! Although they take their mission very seriously, they are able to provide a warm, caring and supportive place for me to call my Largay home!\nLori Seeley\nI have seen Largay travel from being an inside advisor 2002- to an Independent advisor 2015 till now 2025. It has been wonderful watching Largay expand their IC dept. with Melissa leading the way. She is a dedicated teacher with a top notch program. I have had the privilege to watch New to the industry mentees grow and develop amazing successful careers . Largay is always available to support them all the way. Largay is always on the leading edge of new and updated technology with Paul and Amanda at the helm. Vendors all love Largay and offer 110% support to everyone. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI have worked with Largay Travel as an ITC for over 14 years. I would not have been able to achieve anywhere near the success I have enjoyed over those last 14 years without the support, expertise and industry connections afforded me by Largay Travel. The combination of their company ethos of the \"Largay Family\" and their years of experience in the travel industry is unmatched. As a host agency they are unrivaled. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nGreat Support from the Largay Team. Have learned a great deal and have the best tools possible to avail my clients of the most magical trips. As Largay Travel is so well respected in the travel industry, our clients often get VIP treatment as well as extra amenities. Industry knowledge worldwide.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nMy journey with Largay Travel began in 2023, driven by an interest in travel and a friend's encouragement. Stepping into the industry as a novice, I found myself pleasantly surprised by the exceptional mentoring program offered by Largay. From weekly classes to dedicated mentors, marketing tools, and a supportive team, Largay truly equips advisors with everything needed to thrive in the field. It's been an enriching experience, and I'm grateful for the invaluable support provided by Largay Travel. I am looking forward to my growth as an advisor within this company.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI joined Largay as a new travel advisor in July 2020. That's right - during a global pandemic. I was coming in with zero sales experience, but a passion to join the industry due to positive demographics (lots of boomers ready to retire and start traveling) and a desire to serve. My clients and I couldn't have been happier. I have been supported in both my education and in my day-to-day transactions by my host agency. I am exposed to fantastic suppliers, supportive advisors, FAM opportunities, and back office support every single day. Folks are kind, generous with their time and expertise, and very responsive when I need urgent help. I made the right choice (for me) with Largay Travel as my host agency.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI came to Largay Travel after a 30+ year career in another industry and was quite apprehensive about a career change. Their mentoring program gave me the foundation that I needed to make me successful. The owners and front line management are very supportive as are the other IC's. Very happy at Largay. \n1\n1\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been with Largay Travel as an IC for about 7 years now. I love being affiliated with Largay! They are stellar people who care about everyone's growth and success. They are always looking for ways to improve so that we have the best training and tools to succeed. They have a great reputation within the industry which is awesome and helpful for us with our partners. I highly recommend Largay Travel! \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nLargay Travel is an amazing host agency. \"Host\" is not strong enough a word as Largay Travel is more of a supportive family. They provide all the tools necessary to grow and maintain one's business. Nothing is static. They are always on the hunt to do things faster, easier, better.....I count myself lucky and blessed when I start work each day under the Largay umbrella.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nMy journey with Largay Travel began with the guidance of a trusted friend who was also my travel advisor, who then became my mentor through the fantastic educational program Largay Travel offers to aspiring industry professionals. The Largay team held my hand and taught me everything I needed to know to become a successful travel advisor. And the assistance does not end when you graduate. From management to the in-house staff to the phenomenal family of IC's, there is always someone available and willing to help. There is an extraordinary energy among the Largay family and an endless stream of shared knowledge. The Largay reputation is well respected throughout the travel industry and continues to prosper under the skillful leadership of Paul, Amanda, and their management team. I'm immensely grateful for the opportunity to be affiliated with such a wonderful organization!\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI joined Largay in 1998 working as a Corporate Agent. Switch over to leisure and when I thought I was ready to retire Paul asked if I would consider being an independent Contractor. Best decision I ever made... that was in 2009.... \nand still going strong. Thank you Paul for giving me the opportunity.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful.

  "text": "Plaza Travel Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nFinding a good host fit can be difficult. I was with another host but was not satisfied and searched for a new host for almost a year to find the right fit. I was looking for a host that worked with experienced agents and offered GDS (Apollo) capability. I wanted an agency with a great reputation, had established supplier relationships, paid commission in a timely manner, and who had friendly support staff. Although I knew I would be an IC, I wanted to feel I was a respected part of the team. \nI found all of this and more at Plaza Travel. I've worked with Plaza Travel for almost a year now. Steve and his team are a pleasure to work with and I feel I am part of the Plaza Travel \"family\". I receive updates and communication from Plaza Travel on a daily basis so never feel I am \"out of the loop\", yet they are hands-off enough to allow me to grow at my own speed. If I have a GDS issue, it is resolved quickly and courteously by their IT staff. I never have to worry about receiving commission because their accounting department is trustworthy and diligent. Their vendor relationships are strong and their relationship with Signature Travel Network is an added bonus to helping me to build my business. Plaza Travel is the perfect partner for growing my travel business and I cannot imagine being anyplace else. \nJulie Cohn\nI have been delighted to work at Plaza Travel for the last 15 + years. \nSteve Orens & Family are wonderful to work for and highly accessible as well as the support staff is there to help and guide you. \nPlaza Travel also has up-to-date technology & tools, plus their marketing program can help you grow your business \nin addition to our recent partnership with Frosch has been amazing! \nIndependent agents are very supportive and happy to help you and share their love of travel knowledge.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nHi Elisa, thank you for taking the time to leave us a review. Cheers to 15+ years with Plaza Travel! Thank you for being a part of our team! \nI cannot say enough about my experience working with Plaza Travel as my host agency. I have come to depend on the amazing and consistent support from the owners and staff. They are approachable, kind and extremely helpful. The level of support and training provided is exceptional. I have felt so supported and encouraged! Through the challenges of a pandemic, the owner and his team spent countless hours keeping all of the staff and IC's updated on the latest news. They truly want their agents to succeed! I love knowing that I am supported as my business continues to grow. I cannot imagine working for another host!\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nHi Jodie, thank you so much for leaving us a review! We are so happy that you feel supported and encouraged by our team. \nMark DeSimone\nI have been in the Travel Industry for over 30 years and have been with other Host Agencies to understand how they work. Working with Plaza travel and the staff at Plaza travel is always a great experience. Staff members are ALWAYS asking if us IC’s need help with anything or they just check into say hi we haven’t talked in a while and wanted to say hi. \nPlaza Travel is part of Signature Travel Network and the President of Plaza Travel works very closely with Signature. \nDuring this Covid-19 crisis the President Steve has set up weekly “Happy Hour” Zoom meeting and EVERYONE is invited to join even the IC’s. \nAt no time during this Covid-19 crisis have I had to say to myself, why I am I not getting Codid-19 updates from Plaza, the updates come at all hours of the day. \nIf you are looking for a Host Travel Agency look no further than Plaza Travel. \nThank you, Plaza Travel, and the Plaza Travel Staff.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nAs a travel advisor for 22 years, I've seen my share of host agencies. When looking for a new agency to become affiliated with, Plaza Travel seemed to be the agency for me! Not a day has gone by that I am not grateful for the connection I have with the Plaza Travel \"family\", and the Oren's family as well. It's refreshing to feel like I am valued, and that they are there to support my buiness in anyway necessary. Professional, supportive, friendly, are just a few of the words to describe Plaza Travel. Being a part of Signature Travel is a definite bonus to supporting my business as well. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI can't even begin to explain how GREAT Plaza travel is for their host agents! I was with another company for many years. It wasn't a good fit for me. I can honestly say that at Plaza Travel you are FAMILY! They care about your business. They are constantly in contact and asking how you are doing and what they can do to help you. They are part of the Signature Travel Network Consortium. We have the best programs to help us to be the very best for our clients. Steve and the entire Oren's family and team are the best. They truly have our backs and will talk us through any situation. If you are considering a change, I highly recommend this company. You won't be sorry if you sign up with them. You truly will be enveloped by friends and family. There are just too many things big and small to list as to why this Host agency is one of the best! They are about QUALITY and not QUANTITY. \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nOne of the family is how Plaza makes you feel. \nI was previously with another host agency where you were only part of the family as long as you were in their top 25 sellers. This is not how Plaza works. \nEveryone is part of the Plaza family. I could not ask for more support, encouragement or someone to give advice to help my business grow. When ever a vendor finds out that I am with Plaza Travel, Everyones response \"is the Oren family is fantastic and great to partner with.\" That was not the response with my previous host. \nFrom the front desk to the president of the company you always have someone to contact if you have any questions. If you want to grow your business this is the agency for you. \nPlaza also has top status with so many hotels like Four Seasons and Marriott properties that I am able to get my clients perks. They are also on the advisory boards of several major airlines and keeps all of us in the loop regarding those. \nPlaza travel is part of Signature Travel Network which is a huge plus. Steve Oren always keeps both outside agents or inside agents in the loop on everything but still allows me to work under my agency name. From accounting to IT everyone is professional and there for you. Commission is paid in a timely manner and with grasp agent you always know when commissions have come in. \nI can not recommend Plaza Travel enough. If you are looking for a new host look no further and speak with Steve Oren about joining our happy family. \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI was in the market for a new host and reached out to a few suppliers for recommendations and Steve's name kept popping up. I reached out to him and immediately knew that this was a company I wanted to be a part of. It is a true family company in every sense of the word. \nThe support we receive from them is extraordinary and even as an IC I feel very much a part of the company family. They are always reaching to make sure we are doing ok but still giving us the space to run our business. When I go to any travel event the suppliers always make a point to tell me how much they love Plaza travel and the Orens family which goes a long way in showing what a respected and reputable company they are in the industry. \nI truly can't say enough good things about Plaza Travel, it is a breath of fresh air after being with larger more corparate type hosts in the past. The past 2 years with them has proven to me I made the right choice and I highly recommend them to be your choice as well.\n3\n1\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI worked for a wholesaler (Happy Vacations) and was blessed to have Plaza Travel as a client for more than 5 years prior to joining this host agency, so I've got nearly 20 years experience and multiple perspectives on how amazing Steve Orens runs his business. His is a family business on every level, with an amazing and supremely loyal staff that delivers the best customer service in the industry. His caring yet dedicated approach to his agents, both in-house and IC's like myself, compel us to extend that same level of professionalism and courtesy to all of Plaza's customers. Not only does he pay each of us fairly and in a timely manner, he treats us with both a level of respect and trust that I have not seen in my 30+ years in the industry. For anyone looking to establish themselves in the travel industry, I'd highly recommend taking a serious look at Plaza Travel......I couldn't be happier!\n4\n0\n4 people found this review helpful.

That’s when I discovered LuxRally Travel, and honestly, I couldn’t have asked for a better start.\nWhat immediately caught my attention was their no-fee policy for agents. I’d done my homework, and most agencies seemed to nickel-and-dime their agents with various fees. LuxRally, though, was different—they genuinely want their agents to succeed without adding any financial hurdles. For someone just starting out, that was a huge relief.\nBut what really sold me was the technology. LuxRally isn’t just another agency—it’s a tech-driven powerhouse. The CEO, who built the platform himself, has created tools that feel like they were made for someone like me: someone who’s new to the industry but wants to hit the ground running. The booking system is so intuitive that even as a first-time agent, I felt confident navigating it. And the tools for managing client relationships and itineraries? Absolutely seamless. It’s like having a personal assistant built into the system.\nThanks to LuxRally’s revolutionary technology, I’ve been able to focus on what matters most—helping clients create incredible experiences. There’s no time wasted on clunky processes or unnecessary admin work. Instead, I get to channel my energy into learning, growing, and building strong relationships with my travelers.\nStarting my journey with LuxRally Travel feels like the best decision I’ve ever made. They’ve made the transition into this industry so much easier, and I know I’m part of something that’s truly changing the way travel agents work. No fees, incredible support, and cutting-edge tools? It’s exactly what I needed for my first step into this world, and I couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead."

Here again her knowledge is most helpful in determining if these new opportunities fit my objectives as an advisor. I would not continue to work with TerraMar if I did not think it was the best choice for my professional goals. Her many successful agents will echo my thoughts as well.

Did you?\nI have been with Rhonda since she started TerraMar Travel and knew her before. I have been in the industry over 25 years and this is the first host agency that has treated their outside travel agents fairly. Commissions are on time! Number one fault of other hosts! Many opportunities for FAMs and trainings. It is a family of friends when we can travel and learn together. Come onboard -- the training and help is GREAT!\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nRhonda Shumway, owner of TerraMar Travel. is an excellent travel agent and advisor to those working with her.

Did you?\nRhonda Shumway, owner of TerraMar Travel, is an excellent travel agent and advisor to her employees. She is always up-to-date with her information and, if not in her office, gets back to our questions promptly. She is dedicated to her profession and I am proud to be able to work with her.\n0\n1\nDid you find this review helpful?\nUnder the management and leadership of Rhonda, TerraMar Travel is known for its exemplary service and professionalism in all areas of travel.

Rhonda is fair minded and always available to share her vast knowledge. Her connections to key organizations within the industry, including ASTA, NACTA, CCRA and PATH,provide additional support to me as a travel advisor. I have met, traveled with and learned much from other Terra Mar advisors. I am very satisfied with Terra Mar Travel.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nThe joy I experienced when I joined the TerraMar Travel Inc. agents hasn't abated, after over 13 years of working together. Rhonda makes sure we have all we need in training materials and details to keep abreast of what we must know to have a successful business, and she set up an informal internal agent chat exchange system for us to help each other. She includes us in decision making processes that affect us and our clients. She is always available to help with sticky issues or quandries. And, a real plus--When I'm off on a trip or FAM, I know if my clients want help during my absence, they have a supremely talented person to turn to for assistance.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nTerra Mar Travel is absolutely the best Host Agency ever. Most important the owner, Rhonda is the absolute best of all. She is always there when I have a problem and never makes me feel like I am bothering her or that my questions are right or wrong. She plans lots of FAM trips for her agents so that we can benefit to be able to help our clients. \nThank You Rhonda, you are the best!!\nAnna Maria\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

The difference in support and resources is night and day.\nFrom the moment I onboarded, I felt truly valued. Their training programs—especially the extensive content within TTAND University—are unparalleled, giving me the knowledge and confidence to move into higher-end, complex bookings.\nWhat truly sets them apart is the support and community. The back-office team is phenomenal—quick, thoughtful, and always ready to help with a supplier question or a technical snag. I love that I can get a solution within hours. More importantly, the peer community feels like a genuine family. I work from home, but I never feel alone, thanks to the collaborative spirit and encouragement from other agents.\nWith their top-tier supplier relationships and technology that streamlines my administrative tasks, I am spending far less time on paperwork and far more time doing what I love: selling travel. The leadership is visible, approachable, and clearly committed to putting the agent first. If you are looking for a host agency that offers superior support, exceptional training, and a community to help you thrive, I wholeheartedly recommend TTAND!"

She has such a genuine passion for helping others succeed and puts incredible detail and care into everything she teaches. Her training is thorough, easy to follow, and filled with helpful tips that come from real experience! The videos she creates make learning feel approachable and fun, and she’s always so patient and encouraging along the way. I’m so grateful for all the time and effort she invests in her mentees. Especially with answering all our many questions. She’s truly helped me grow in confidence and skill as a travel agent.\nAlison Raskin\nWhen I started I was a brand new travel advisor and didn't know where to begin. Tiffani's trainings and willingness to provide any support needed during training and thereafter was the whole reason I was able to start booking trips before I had even completed training. There is no way that I would have been able to start this new journey in my career without Tiffani.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nWorking with Haley has been an incredible experience and I don't think I would have succeeded without her! She has mastered the entire travel experience - how to manage planning the trip, booking it, in-destination support, and the follow up. It's no surprise she has so many repeat clients! Every session leaves me inspired, better informed, and motivated to take the next step. I’m deeply grateful for Haley’s mentorship and would highly recommend her to anyone looking to elevate their career or business in the travel industry.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nMy experience working with Tiffani has been incredible. She’s so detailed, knowledgeable, and excited to help new advisors succeed. The training videos she's created cover everything from the nitty-gritty details like where to find a client’s birthday or how to keep track of tasks, to broader topics like pulling commission reports or working with in-country partners. She’s taught me so much about how to sell travel effectively and ensure my clients have an amazing experience. It’s a ton of information, but it’s presented in a clear, organized, and engaging way. I still go back and review those materials and find them so helpful. I definitely wouldn’t be where I am today without the support and guidance I’ve gotten from Tiffani.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI met Byrd, Haley and Tiffani after starting with a different travel agency. The difference was night and day. These three ladies know what they are doing! They teach you how to sell and all the ins & outs of travel. They want you to succeed and see you as an extension of them. They build a community based on collaboration and trust. They are highly organized, which makes your job easier. I am so happy I found them that I have recommended several people to the company.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nTiffani is an exceptional mentor and trainer whose kindness, professionalism, and thorough approach made my entry into a completely new profession seamless. Her training style is clear, structured, and highly effective — she ensures every concept is understood and applicable in real-world scenarios. I can confidently say I wouldn’t have reached my goals and milestones so early in my new career without her guidance and support. Tiffani truly sets her trainees up for long-term success in the travel industry.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI have worked with Haley for 2 years and have been amazed by what she has accomplished. She has created an incredible client base for herself and made some insane sales. I've been honored to have her coach me for a few months now. She does a great job with helping me understand how to grow my business and protect my boundaries with tough clients. Plus, she's a wonderful person :) \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nHaley is an incredibly supportive and caring professional. She is top-notch to work with!

Our owner Patti is well versed and knowledgeable regarding Travel. Which stems from her years of experience, starting as an agent, to office manager, & now owner. We have a fantastic back-office team which gives Patti time to deal with her long-time clients & other responsibilities.

When I contact a TO, BDM, etc. and state I am an advisor with The Travel Gallery, I always get a prompt and timely response. The owner, Patti Stevens is makes time to advise you on how you can grow your business without being pushy or making it intimidating. The other advisors I have met and interacted with are super knowledgeable, friendly and are willing to help if you have a question.

  "text": "The Vacation Wizards Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nI have been with The Vacation Wizards for 6+ years now and it has been the best decision I could have made. First of all, having direct contact with a mentor to help you get started and to have a specific person available for all of those beginner questions is priceless. The agency has amped up their training and has a great program to introduce new agents to the world of travel. Besides that, mini training sessions throughout the year help agents keep up to date and learn new things to help them grow. We also have great relationships with our vendors which equals to even more training opportunities. \nThere is an initial fee, and then a yearly renewal fee, but no other hidden costs. I feel like the commission splits are fair and increasing them is easily attainable. Randy and Cheryl are great to work with, very professional and they are behind you and willing to help out in any situation. \nWe have a great work environment-really a family atmosphere, and everyone is eager to help each other out. Our yearly conference is a fantastic time for new education and reconnecting with our fellow agents, it’s something we look forward to all year long. I absolutely love my Wizard Family and cannot imagine a better work environment. \nHeather Swearingen\nI have been with The Vacation Wizards for 6+ years now and it has been the best decision I could have made.

It has been an wonderful experience to be a Wizard. I was provided with a mentor and a team and the fit could not have been better. They feel more like family than colleagues. I have never been a part of such a supportive and encouraging team as I have with the Vacation Wizards. The Vacation Wizards not only provides a supportive environment, but they also provide ample opportunities for growth and learning as a travel professional. I feel honored to be a part of this incredible agency. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nI've been a Wizard since 2017. It was genuinely one of the best decisions I've ever made. I was totally new to travel when I joined, but was determined to learn and succeed. With their training and mentor program, I was matched with a wonderful mentor who has helped me do just that. She has become a valued friend and ally. The agency strives to create a family environment where we all work as a team, rather than pitting us against each other competitively. This fosters a comfortable place for us to work, help each other out, and have a lot of fun. We have access to training, our mentors, and a CRM for client info and bookkeeping. There is a small upfront fee, but no monthly costs. Commissions are paid promptly, and our commission split is good. Individual success is celebrated and rewarded at our annual agency conference, along with special recognition throughout the year. Our agency owner is actively involved in all aspects of the agency. He treats all agents with respect and integrity. He is constantly looking for ways to make our experience better with new opportunities to learn and grow. I genuinely love what I do and the people I do it with, and would recommend our agency 100%. \n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

So many options felt like MLMs, and I didn’t want that. Then a friend recommended The Wander Network, and everything changed.\nI did my research, and they truly sounded like the perfect fit… so I decided to take a leap of faith and join. From the moment I started the signup process, Shannon, the CEO, was incredibly personable and responsive. That alone made me feel like I made the right choice.\nI’ve now been with The Wander Network for just 4 months, and it has hands down been one of the best decisions I’ve made. I’m new to the travel world, and the amount of support I’ve received has been amazing. The other agents are genuinely kind and always willing to help, no matter how big or small the question is. It truly feels like a second family.\nWe have weekly meetings every Wednesday covering different topics and suppliers, which keeps us sharp and up to date. Kellie, the VP, and Shannon have both gone above and beyond for me, whether I needed guidance, had a question, or just needed reassurance, they were only a call or email away. Their support has been invaluable.\nThey also give you the tools to succeed from day one, and once you attend your first retreat, they even offer leads to help you grow your business. The amount of resources, training, and encouragement they provide has made me feel confident booking trips and building my travel business.\nThank you Shannon and Kellie for helping make this dream become a reality."

The staff keeps their agents informed of sales, fams and latest technology that is available. The staff is also honest, has high moral standards and want the best for their agents to succeed. The staff is always encourage agents to expand their knowledge through fams or any other means of education. \nI would highly recommend Travel Leaders/Travel Now to any travel agent who is looking for a Host Agency. I don't think you would regret it!!\n2\n0\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

  "text": "Luxevo Vacations Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nI have been in many MLM businesses over the years and did not want to enter into another one. I contacted a current local agent and asked if this was a real deal. I have been with Luxevo Vacations almost 1 year and I have to say, it has been phenomenal. The moment I signed up, I was greeted with a personal phone call from Burt Kramer himself. Burt has created a business that is affordable, educational, supportive and creative to make your business a success. Luxevo Vacations has given us agents every opportunity to be successful through online tools and office, live webinars, FAM trips, 3DTI (3 Day Training Intensive, located at Corporate Brandenton, FL), on call staff in every aspect of the business, agents willing and able to assist you in your business. The staff is fabulous and actually care about you and you being successful in your business. The business back office that is provided to you, the day you sign on with Luxevo as your host agency; gives you all the tools to be successful in your first 120 days or at your own pace. I have had many businesses over the years and the expense of running your own business, can be daunting and expensive. I have every business tool at my disposal and assistance if I am unsure how to use it. I had the pleasure to meet Burt and Patricia Kramer last June at the 3DTI in Bradenton, Florida. I was immediately greeted with a large smile and a selfie! Burt and Patricia are as down to earth, grateful and blessed to be able to help their agents succeed. I am honored to call Luxevo Vacations, my host agency. I look forward to a long lasting relationship with Burt and Patricia Kramer and their successful business of Luxevo Vacations. \nTammy Rainbolt\nPrior to joining Luxevo Vacations in January 2019, I had longed for a career in travel. Years ago I wasn't quite sure how to do it with many options and fees with other host agencies it was out of range for me because it was so expensive and you didn't get much information on what you were going to get from your membership. Years later I came across an advertisement for Luxevo Vacations with the owner and visionary, Burt Kramer talking so enthusiastically about a career in travel....I immediately felt something special and on the right path to my purpose. This host agency is family; and they do so much to help and assist you to succeed in this business. You are never alone, vast resources supplied to you,learning seminars to attend, and frequent travel agent training trips at your disposal so that you can experience fantastic resorts and come home with that experience to share with your potential clients! I absolutely love my journey with this company!\n15\n2\n15 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI met Burt and Patricia when I was with another host agency. liked them right \naway. They are so real, warm and friendly as is the entire staff. \nWhen they announced they were opening a host agency, I did not hesitate. Their reputation in the industry is top notch. \nSo many host agencies do not communicate well. Luxevo has webinar training digital marketing material for you to use at no extra cost. \nLove them. \nThey are family and you are part of that family. \n13\n2\n13 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nLuxevo Vacations give Host Agency a whole new meaning. There truly is not another host agency like them. From Burt & Patricia (and the whole corporate team) to the training, to support, to the exclusive assets provided and the way all the agents help each other, it is a wonderful family business. If you are considering a career in travel Luxevo Vacations provides the best opportunity for success!!!\n10\n4\n10 people found this review helpful.

Did you?\nThe training and support is great! They give the necessary tools to help you succeed. They treat you like family.\n11\n4\n11 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nComing from another host agency, I for sure did my research. I looked at many different host agencies because I knew exactly what I needed. The minute I began talking to Burt Kramer, I KNEW I found my home. Even though I had a background in travel, Luxevo Vacations training options exceeded my expectations and needs. I have a passion for travel! Every staff member, and travel specialist, have the same passion and are willing to help one another become successful. We are not only a team, we are a family. I am truly blessed to apart of such a wonderful company. Each staff member is very genuine and caring. They also stay on top of the industry changes and continue to train all of the specialist with current information. Luxevo Vacations not only has an exceptional training plan, they also offer many FAM trips and also host a Three Day Intensive Training in Florida for all specialists multiple times a year. Being a successful travel specialist has been my dream and becoming part of the family with Luxevo Vacations, my dream has come true. I highly recommend Luxevo Vacations as a host agency!\n12\n3\n12 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI spent many years as a travel agent before taking some time away from the industry to do other things. When I decided I wanted to get back into travel, the independent contractor really appealed to me - Being my own boss! I signed on initially with another host, based on the recommendation of someone I knew who had been with them for years. I quickly realized that they were not a good fit for me, so I ended my relationship with them and started over again. Luxevo vacations kept coming up on my Facebook ad, so I reached out to Burt, and at that moment I knew I had found where I needed to be. I have been extremely happy with all aspects: the people, the support, the technology, and the training. From the first day, I have totally felt like a member of the Luxevo Vacations family, and I am surrounded by a fabulous group of colleagues. After six months, I feel they have exceeded my expectations! The staff is friendly and eager to help me succeed. I highly recommend Luxevo Vacations to anyone interested in becoming a travel professional.\n12\n3\n12 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nLuxevo Vacations is the right host agency for me! I love to travel and wanted to turn my passion into profit by sending clients on their dream vacations. Luxevo Vacations, under the leadership of Burt Kramer and his team, are fantastic to work with! The host provides support like no other host agency – self-paced online training, top notch suppliers, FAM trips, 3-day intensive training face-to-face course, social support via Facebook group, and the list goes on! I am new to the travel industry and I feel supported with the tools and technology to be successful as a new travel specialist! I highly recommend Luxevo Vacations!\n12\n3\n12 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWhen I decided that I wanted to become a travel agent/specialist, I didn't tell anyone. I started to do research on starting my own travel agency. One day in March 2019 I was surfing my Facebook feed and Burt Kramer came up on a video asking me if I love to travel and help others with their travel and get to visit resorts and have my own travel business. To make a long story short I signed up after watching his full video in March 2019 and that was the only research that I needed. I love the fact that they offering training both online and at their headquarter office in Bradenton, FL. the entire Luxevo Vacations staff treats you as if you are family and is very supportive and helpful with growing your travel business. I've been invited and attended FAM trips with Luxevo Vacations which were related to my niche and enjoyed the site inspections of the resorts. \nI could write a book about this wonderful host agency and their staff and family. If you are looking for a host agency that will be there for you everyday and helps with all aspects of growing your business and obtaining leads, this is the host agency for you. Burt and Patricia treat you not only like a business partner but family too. I look forward to continued partnering with them for my travel business. \n12\n3\n12 people found this review helpful.

My previous experience was as an agent in Australia and things do not necessarily translate exactly from one market to the other. \nWe're also extremely fortunate to have a great team who's varied expertise mean there's always someone to bounce ideas off.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nAfter working in Operations for a Travel wholesaler, I decided to transition into becoming a Travel Agent. I spent weeks searching for a host agency that I was comfortable with and came across VacationKids. VacationKids is an amazing host agency. I have been an Independent Contractor with them for a little under a year but it has been an amazing journey. Sally gives the best training and makes sure that we are all kept up to date on hot topics and new properties. Along with Sally, our dynamic team works hard to make sure that we all succeed and that is extremely important to being successful in this industry.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been working at VacationKids for about a year and a half now. It's a part time position for me and one that I truly enjoy. Sally Black, the founder and owner is amazing to work with! Her knowledge of the travel industry is phenomenal and she is willing to share her experience with her people. She lets us set our own pace and encourages us to market ourselves through contributing to blogs, our own Facebook pages and travel industry events. I also feel that our commission split is fair and reasonable. The other agents are all supportive of one another. Everyone is willing to answer questions and help each other out. I am happy that I took the step to join this agency and hope for a long association.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI've been working as an IC for Vacation Kids for almost a year. I actually was introduced by hostagencyreviews.com, and reached out to Sally through this site. I was drawn to this agency because it didn't feel like a lot of the agencies where there was a membership fee and an 800 number. I was inexperienced in this industry and wanted some guidance and support, and felt like that would be offered with Vacation kids. Sally is very personally involved with all of the agents, ensures that you have the training you need to effectively sell travel. The split is pretty reasonable especially considering that your aren't required any investment to get started. You really can build at your own pace.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nVacationKids, owned by Sally Black, is a great agency to work with. Sally truly works with you individually and as a team to help you learn the industry at your pace. She is very generous with her time and sharing her experience, expecting honesty, integrity, and fair work in return. \nThe commission split is very reasonable and agents have a lot of opportunity to grow their business.\nThe ICs working with VacationKids are a great team, all with different areas of expertise. We really do work together and help each other out which makes a huge difference in being able to help clients.\n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nSign up for a free account to submit reviews."

  "text": "World Travel Specialists Host Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nAs we all know the travel industry is very competitive ,I use all the resources that have been given to me by Jane Fencer (owner at World Travel Specialists). Personal customer service is the key to making my home based a success . Constantly taking courses to gain knowledge and attending webinars . I find each day I look at the specials that are in my emails , network on Facebook Business page . When I get a lead I offer and incentive to that new client which has given me clients that have returned . I set aside time daily to do leads and network outside of my home. The world will not come to you it is the personal service that I give that helps me increase my clients in my business.\nAnne Eriole\nWhen I found World Travel Specialists I wasn't sure what I was really getting into. I have to say since I have joined the agency Jane (owner) been very welcoming and been there to answer all my questions. She has the patience's of a saint I swear I have asked questions I would deem silly but she keeps reminding me that there is no silly question. \nThe Agency and the other agents are amazing. There isn't enough words to express how the other agents jump right in to help when you need help.\nI love the Fact there wasn't was monthly fee that I have read about with the other agency's. After a lot of research, the start up fee really felt like it was very fair to me. On top of everything else Jane given the agents so many tools to work with. I Give WTS 100 Plus Stars. \nI am really excited to grow with the agency for many years to come.\n7\n1\n7 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI love this company Jane (the owner) is very helpful and answers my millions of questions all the time. Plus we have such great sites to work with and I have booked so many trips already that people say have the best prices!! I love this company\n5\n1\n5 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI would definitely recommend anyone looking to work within the travel business to contact WTS. Jane Fencer (owner) is amazing. Very helpful and offers a tremendous amount of assistance to all of the agents.\n4\n0\n4 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI tried for awhile to get into the travel business and my first encounter was not a good one the agent was rude and I was slightly discouraged but determined I kept searching and looking and looked thru quite a few host agents but many wanted high start up cost and monthly fees, then I found World Travel Specialists and I could not have made a better choice I absolutely love working for this agency. I've learned so much and Jane is soooooo helpful that I would absolutely recommend this agency for anyone looking for a GREAT host will always go above and beyond for you and your clients!\n6\n0\n6 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI am so excited to learn the travel business with World Travel Specialists! In just the few weeks Jane has supplied me so much knowledgeable information with this I am looking forward to assisting people with their travel needs.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nI don't even know where to begin. I Love working with this agency and couldn't have pick a better one. I did my research with other companies, and choose to go with World Travel Specialists for many reason's. Low cost, No monthly fee's, Plenty of training, and much more. Jane (Agency owner) is alway's more than willing to answer question's, Very Professional and friendly. I highly recommend this agency to anyone no matter your experience.\nDid I mention the pay was Excellent? I tell all of my friends and stranger's about joining this agency. That is how much I LOVE it! I could go on and on about this agency, but you get the idea.. Look no further than World Travel Specialist. She deserve's a 100 star's but I am only allowed to give a 5+++++++++++. :)\n5\n0\n5 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nAfter being with another host agency for 4 years and paying a monthly fee World Travel Specialists is a breathe of fresh air. Jane (owner) is great. She always makes time for you. Any questions you have or ideas she is ready to listen. If you are looking for a host agency this is the place to stop.\n5\n1\n5 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have found working with a small(er) agency to be less of a headache trying to find the right person to ask a question. The agency owner (Jane) encourages the agents to befriend each other and pick each others' brains for information and assistance. Also the commissions are fair and the lack of monthly and/or annual fees is great!\n4\n0\n4 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nThe emails and constant stream of valuable information are great. There are so many opportunities to learn which for someone fairly new to the business are great. I feel connected to both Jane and my fellow agents even though we are separated by distance. It has been a pleasure to meet some of my fellow agents and look forward to meeting more.Would definetely reccomend to someone new to the travel business\n3\n0\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nWorld Travel Specialists is a great host to work with. All the training that you will ever need is provided. The sign up fee is well worth it. In return you receive things that you do not get with other host agencies that have higher sign up and monthly fees.\n5\n0\n5 people found this review helpful.

I was initially skeptical, thinking it was too good to be true because there was no fee as other agencies are charging, but after speaking with Tricia Lenington and Jerry Saxe, I was very excited to get started! \nI came in with no training in January of 2023 when I found Host Week 2023 and logged in to listen to the agency reps. As soon as Tricia began talking about Carlisle Travel I immediately began researching any information I could find online and sent an email. Within the first few days I was signed up for agency orientation, guided through where to find education modules, shown resources and tools and Tricia was always available to answer questions. And even though I am in the northeast and they are in the southwest, for the very first time in three years I felt like I was not alone! Jerry was so amazing helping me with my bio and getting me positioned in the google-search feeds that I received my first email and phone call leads within 2 weeks of signing my contract. And within my first month of signing I had very my first sale ever as a travel agent. I had spent almost two whole years with a company that offered an outdated back office for $500/year and no training or even an explanation of how to use their back office. I truly wish I had found Carlisle Travel 2 years sooner! \nI feel like Jerry and Tricia truly want me to succeed and will do anything to help me achieve any goals I set for myself. And I am truly grateful to have found them and become a part of their team. I would highly recommend Carlisle Travel as a host agency for anyone new or experienced. \nDebra Brewbaker\nJoining Carlisle Travel as an Independent Agent has fast-tracked my career in the travel industry. Jerry and his team help leverage my business through premiere partnerships and industry leading platforms, which provide my clients a top shelf experience!

Did you?\nAs a direct result of Jerry and his dedicated staff I have had the most rewarding year since beginning my career in the travel industry 20 years ago. The personal support, availability of Jerry and staff and the variety of tour companies has allowed me to grow my client base beyond anything I imagined possible. I’ve been apart of other agency’s and none offered the patience, availability or knowledge that Jerry has allotted me. \nCarlisle Travel Management has a superior reputation in the travel industry. My clients have the peace of mind that they are being cared for by a well-established and professionally managed company. They have my recommendation to anyone searching for a new host agency. \n2\n1\n2 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI've been affiliated with Carlisle Travel Management for almost 2 years. My colleague & I found ourselves without a host quite abruptly when our former host went bankrupt and we had to scramble to find a new \"home\" for our GDS needs. We contacted 3 agencies and instantly felt like Carlisle was the place to be. We had a few conference calls with Jerry Saxe to make sure we were making the right decision and he made us feel welcomed. We were also in a hurry to get up and running quickly as we both work Corporate & Vacation travel and our Corporate clients were patiently waiting for us to get set up- Jerry was fantastic at getting us set up with Amadeus within 24 hours. Things have been running very smoothly with Carlisle and we are very happy with where we landed! Highly recommend as a host for those seeking one!\n4\n1\n4 people found this review helpful.

  "text": "Cruise Planners Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nMy husband and I started with Cruise Planners in May of 2019. We were very new to the industry. We had started with another home-based company approximately 8 months prior, but we received minimal support. In those 8 months, we only had a handful of bookings, and most of them were our own reservations.\nWhile attending the CLIA conference in April of 2019, we saw alot of people wearing the \"CP green\" shirts. So, we started asking some of them about Cruise Planners. Every single person we spoke with said they absolutely LOVED Cruise Planners, and they were very happy with their decision to join the CP family.\nAfter more research, we decided to make the switch, and we are extremely happy that we did!\nThe support that we've received from the Cruise Planners home office has been fantastic. The CP technology is state-of-the-art. The coaches are very responsive, and they are in place to help us build our businesses. In addition, having access to the Facebook page that is set up for CP advisors has allowed me to obtain a significant amount of super helpful information from my CP colleagues. \nThe CP home office staff truly cares, and they are very supportive, and we really feel that they want us to succeed. In addition to the cutting edge technology and the outstanding coaching, they also provide marketing, training, and more.\nMy husband and I set a goal for ourselves to make the company's Top 50 list within our first five years. We were able to accomplish our goal within our first year- even with the COVID situation in full swing. We have now built our business into a multi-million dollar company, and we could not be more happy with our Cruise Planners franchise."

  "text": "Cruise Planners Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nWhen I purchased my Cruise Planners franchise, I had no experience as a travel advisor. They taught me everything I needed to know and gave me great tools to use. They are always upgrading and improving their tools so that I can grow my business quickly and easily. Then there’s the culture! The leadership of Cruise Planners can’t be beat. I’ve never worked with such incredible people—and I’m 68 so I’ve worked for Fortune 500 companies and medium-sized companies too. These people are the best! \nAnita O'Donnell\nMy husband I purchased our Cruise Planner franchise in August 2008. At the time I was working part-time at my full-time job while caring for my husband as he battled cancer, and our stress levels were through the roof and it was totally and utterly the wrong time to start a business. Oh and we had never been on a cruise ship yet we were looking at selling cruises from home. But there is a saying \"Out of your greatest challenges comes your greatest victories.\" We started with Cruise Panners on a part-time basis and totally found our passion for helping others create experiences and memories. Cruise Planners' training and support are incredible!! The technology they bring to the table to help us keep track of everything is first-rate and they continue to improve. The marketing department is incredible; they come up with some amazing marketing campaigns for us. Some of them have even won awards! They keep bringing us new training and learning opportunities. They work tirelessly on the relationships with our preferred vendors to bring us amazing deals to pass along to our clients. They are continually looking for vendors to partner with to help us make our client's experience that much more special. It still blows my mind how much they have done for us and continue to do for us to help us grow our business.\nYou not only get support from those at head office to help you but other agents are willing to reach out and help you too and you find yourself helping other Cruise Planner agents. Everyone at Cruise Planners is like a member of the family. Convention every year is a big family reunion. I am so thankful that we decided to move ahead and purchase a Cruise Planners franchise. I am now full-time in my Cruise Planners business and I love leaping out of bed each morning and helping others to create unique experiences and memories. \nIf you want to talk more about a Cruise Planners franchise then please ask to be connected with me and I will be happy to talk with you. Have a super fantastic sparkling day!!\n84\n5\n84 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have owned my Cruise Planners franchise for a little over a year and couldn't be happier with the choice I made. I came into this profession without having any professional travel experience - and without having any sales experience. I had always loved traveling with my family and friends and found this career choice to be a perfect transition from the corporate world. I will be honest - it was somewhat overwhelming at first because there is so much to learn and I wanted to be the best at my new career so I could serve my clients properly. But the Cruise Planners family was so welcoming to me and offered the education, tutoring, advice, and the support I needed, and I can honestly say that I found the perfect 'home' when I joined this organization. I also had wanted a good brand to stand behind me and I got both from Cruise Planners and American Express. The technology this company provides us is just outstanding - but don't be scared if you're not a 'techy' person because they make it very simple!\nThe positive aspects of Cruise Planners is just astounding - I don't have one negative thing to say about this organization. Cruise Planners is more than just a name - it's a solid company with a solid reputation who stands with and supports its franchise owners. They truly want us to succeed so we can all grow and prosper in this exceptional and exciting industry.\nIf you have any hesitation at all as to whether to go forward with purchasing a Cruise Planners American Express franchise just call me! :)\nTerry S. McKinney \nMaster Cruise Counselor & Luxury Cruise Specialist\n54\n4\n54 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been with Cruise Planners since 2004 and it seemed like only yesterday that I was wrestling with the idea of purchasing a franchise. I had no previous experience in the travel industry and I had only been on one cruise! What was I thinking?!?! I was thinking what a great opportunity to own my own business, enhance my travel knowledge and have FUN.\nAs you can imagine, I needed lots of help from Cruise Planners and what I found with this company is exactly that. I have always had the support and training I needed to succeed. Cruise Planners gave me all the tools and the coaching that I needed when I began my business and the support is still just as strong today. If I have questions or need new ideas, marketing or general support with anything, Cruise Planners is an email or phone call away and they are always willing to help. \nCruise Planners is not out to just sell franchises, they WANT us to succeed. When we succeed, the company as a whole succeeds. That is why Cruise Planners is highly respected in the cruise industry and have won numerous awards. It is very important to me to have a strong name and brand to represent my business and Cruise Planners/American Express is that company.\nIf I had it to do all over again, I would choose Cruise Planners, hands down!\n41\n3\n41 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have had my Cruise Planners Franchise for about 2 1/2 years. I absolutely love it, there are no words to describe how this company took my life in a whole new direction, It was of my best decisions ever made. I came from a building industry and prior to that i was a Cosmetologist....I had no idea what i was doing in the travel field other than my own travel. With my strong will to succeed,my incredible passion and the wonderful guidance of Cruise Planners tools, marketing and incredible staff. They are AWESOME!\nMaria Tilton\n32\n4\n32 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI've been with Cruise Planners for 4 years and just love it! \nI was with another host before CP, and they just treated me like a number. They said they offered support & training, but once you joined there was nothing. CP is the opposite! We get assigned a Coach who shares not only their wealth of experience (having been agents and /or cruise line staff), but they share best practices from other CP agents. From their CEO and other executives...to every last employee at Home Office...they care and want to see us all succeed. They have passion and I truly feel a part of a family.\nI haven't missed one annual convention yet as it is like a family reunion...and we learn sooooo much with all of the speakers that come....and from each other. It's such a great event. This year I attending one of the Regional meetings, as well as two incredible land FAM's. CP presents us with so many learning opportunities to help us succeed (including and online university).\nTo boot.....the technology is incredibly easy to use and the best I've ever used. I looooove the fact I can use my iPhone to access my database/CRM....it's let me WOW my customers because I'm so much more efficient & quicker to respond to their inquiries. \nI can go on and on... \nBut suffice to say... \nI highly recommend you check out Cruise Planners.\n35\n1\n35 people found this review helpful.

I was having a difficult time keeping up with the competition when it came to marketing and keeping my name out front. From day one with Cruise Planners I was blown away on the direct mail pieces and electronic flyers emailed to my clients. The technology is 1st class and so simple to book.

  "text": "Cruise Planners Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nHaving been an independent contractor with a small Mom and Pop local travel agency that focused on Disney travel for about eight years, I had been looking to extend my wings and fly the proverbial chicken coop for a few years. Knowing there was more to travel than just Disney, I had been exploring options and investigating many agencies on and off for a couple years.\nMy family and I loved cruising, international travel and going to all-inclusive resorts, so I looked at 4-5 other well-known agencies, but really was impressed with Cruise Planners. No matter how many groups and consortiums I looked at, and which one I favored, I always kept going back to the \"Team In Green!\" They had ALL Travel covered and included, with great references, superb affiliations and a stellar reputation. \nWhen Covid hit in 2020, that is when I decided it was the ideal time for me to make my franchise purchase with Cruise Planners. Crazy? Nope. Ingenious? Yep!! Business had slowed enough to make a smooth transition with my existing client base (all family, friends and referrals) to attend Star-U, set-up my files, get all the updates and training completed and just GO for the gusto!!!\nThe technology, the people, the support, and the connections at Cruise Planners are the best of the best. The powerful CP affiliation is a badge of honor that I wear with pride daily! It was/is honestly the BEST decision I have ever made for business. I set aside the start-up funds, looked over the paperwork, signed and send, please take my money. Now, I am the boss of me and I LOVE IT!\nI am so glad I finally mustered up the courage to take the leap of faith, trust my gut, go with my instincts and become a \"GREENIE!\" Since February 2021 I have added two Independent Contractors, one in 2022 and the other in 2023. We have successfully made it into the \"Millionaire's Club\" based on our overall sales annually for the past two years. We will continue to flourish, learning about new & exciting destinations, making new connections with various vendors, visiting new locations and venues and most importantly travelling all over discovering the world one continent at a time.\nMichelle Fee is such a heroine and role-model for women-owned businesses and I contribute most of my CP success to her and her vision, her dreams and her drive that she injects into each of us on the daily (through webinars, newsletters, seminars, conferences, boot camps, summits, invitational events, the list just goes on and on and on). Support, care, commitment, compassion, love, family and success are all attributes that are associated with being a Cruise Planners Family Member, and we are ALL one big, happy FAMILY!\nCruise Planners is my dream come true! I am forever grateful, totally blessed and forever thankful for the Cruise Planners model for Travel Franchise Owners. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nLove, \nCharlene (Char) Daley \nchar.daley@cruiseplanners.com \nwww.travelfunseaandsun.com \n610-909-4795 \nEssington, just outside PHL, PA \nHave a great day!!"

  "text": "NEST Plus Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nSo I had a totally independent agency and I was looking for a new consortium and wanted to be part of NEST. I wasn't sure my sales were high enough (later I discovered they were more than) so when Rosemary told me there was host agency within NEST called NEST PLUS. It didn't take me the weekend to realize, I was tired of being alone and on my own. I needed to have some support. True support.\nI have all I want and need from NEST and PLUS I have the backing and support of a strong, confident, pleasant, loving and kind family. I have described Nest, Nest Plus and Travelsavers as being a big tree, with many branches and lots of leaves. And that's what it really is. It's a home. \nI describe my once independent agency as a Boutique Host Agency. That means, we still take on new and sort of experienced agents, but, we are ourselves hosted. And I'm okay with that now. Everything I need is here, and if there is something I'd like to see, they take your suggestons and ideas serious.\nThere is a reason geese flock together and fly in a v formation. You can only be in the front for so long, and then you need to fall back and allow the wing support of all the others in your flock to help you get to your next destination. NEST PLUS is like that flock of geese. I was on my own for so long, I didn't even realize how much I needed the support of others to make it.\nI can tell, the relationships with the agents and agency owners beind the scenes is one of family. They all care and share and want to see each other succeed. Thank you Rosemary, Wayen and Maureen for reminding me all the time, that sometimes, it's better to be part of a flock."

  "text": "Legato Host Reviews | Host Agency Reviews\nAll Reviews\nTop Review\nI have been with Legato for a little over 2 years and am very happy to be a part of the Legato family. I spoke with Jonathan when I was looking into a host agency. He was informative and very easy to speak with. I was looking to join a host agency that I would feel comfortable with and that I could also learn with. Between Jonathan and Bill Morris , they both have been supportive and they encourage you even when you feel nervous as a new agent and offer one on one trainings that you can sign up for. I am still growing and learning and am glad they are there to support me.\nTerry McCullough\nI cannot say enough great things about my experience with Legato! From the moment I partnered with them to grow my travel business, they have exceeded every expectation. Their industry expertise, top-tier supplier relationships, and comprehensive training programs have been invaluable in helping me succeed.\nThe support team is truly outstanding—responsive, knowledgeable, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure I have everything I need. The commission structure is very competitive!\nOne of the things I appreciate most is the sense of community. Through networking events, webinars, and mentorship opportunities, I’ve connected with experienced travel professionals who have inspired and guided me. I never feel like I’m navigating this industry alone!\nIf you’re looking for a host agency that truly cares about your success, Legato is the perfect choice. I’m so grateful to be part of this exceptional organization and highly recommend them to any travel advisor looking to take their business to the next level! \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nHi Lamerle, we appreciate this review as it captures the heart of Legato and what we've worked hard to build for our agents. Thanks so much for the kind words and it's been great working with you! \nNothing but greatness here! Love all of the support and commission structure! They provide you with all the resources you need and constantly is evolving with upgrades and new integrations with their native CRM they've launched a new learning initiative to enhance, especially newer agents' knowledge regarding the industry, and provide a great supplier showcase with a ton of great information with a robust catalog of suppliers \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nThanks for the great review and for sharing what makes Legato unique, Jeremy! We're excited to have you on the team and watching you grow through the years.\nLegato has got to be THE BEST host agency around. I don't know anyone else with such great people to work with. I have called and had appointments with several other Hosts and I am so glad I went with Legato. The owners are calm and understanding. And when things get tough they are there to help. There is a great platform of agents and we all like to help each other and want each other to succeed. One thing I would change is the yearly conference. It is a little expensive for the area it is in. But they do have a virtual conference as well which helps. You will not get leads with them but they will help you with some tips on how to get leads. They are fair on commissions and do not expect you to be a high performing agent. Come as you are. \n0\n0\nDid you find this review helpful?\nThanks for the great review and feedback, Lindsay!\nFinding the right host agency was a nerve-wracking process for me. I would come across glowing reviews about a company, only to find another that made me second-guess everything. After months of research and careful consideration, I couldn’t be happier with my decision to join Legato.\nNow, three months in, I can confidently say that the team at Legato genuinely cares about the agents they work with. They are innovative, forward-thinking, and committed to providing the tools and support needed for success. Every host agency is different, and what works for one agent may not work for another. However, if you're considering an independent host model, know that Legato is truly dedicated to empowering its hosted agencies with the resources they need to thrive.\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nHi Jefferson, thanks so much for the review! It's been great working with you and we look forward to helping you reach your goals.\nI joined Legato about a year ago. I had some travel background with family and friends, but took the plunge to start my own business. SO happy with the Legato family, all the support and hands-on that the other agents provide as well as Bill and Jonathan and the amazing Legato staff. They provide many vetted suppliers for all specialties and niches which helps to give our clients a variety of different experiences depending on their needs. I am truly happy that I chose Legato as my host agency!\n1\n0\n1 person found this review helpful. Did you?\nHey Cori, we appreciate the kind words and for taking the time to share the love!

Did you?\nHi Trida, Thank you for the great review. It's been a joy working with you over the years. Here's to more success and fun in the future!\nAfter almost thirty years in the hospitality sector, transitioning into a travel advisor role has broadened my horizons beyond expectations. Bill and Jonathan create a warm, familial atmosphere and offer exceptional training, which has been instrumental in my journey towards becoming a top-tier travel and concierge services provider.\n3\n2\n3 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been with Legato for a little over 2 years and am very happy to be a part of the Legato family. I spoke with Jonathan when I was looking into a host agency. He was informative and very easy to speak with. I was looking to join a host agency that I would feel comfortable with and that I could also learn with. Between Jonathan and Bill Morris , they both have been supportive and they encourage you even when you feel nervous as a new agent and offer one on one trainings that you can sign up for. I am still growing and learning and am glad they are there to support me.\n4\n0\n4 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI have been with Legato since April 2019, and have grown with them. They continue to add suppliers and resources that make my job easier. Legato allows you to run your business the way you want to run it, while offering support along the way. It has been a great partnership. Looking forward to see how we continue to grow.\n4\n1\n4 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nI've only been an advisor for 10 months and I'm so glad I chose Legato as my host agency! What appealed to me at first were the commission cut and lack of monthly and annual fees. I knew income would be low during the building stage and Legato's business model made sense. The Annual Conference was so helpful. I heard firsthand about the different suppliers and their offerings. Several are now on my super supplier list. The other Legato agents are so nice and very helpful. The feeling of instant connection, friendship and lack of competition with each other is special. The Legato team is also focused on bringing us the best in travel technology so we can compete and succeed in this industry. Thank you Bill and Jonathan for all you do for us!\n4\n1\n4 people found this review helpful. Did you?\nHi Keri, thanks for the glowing review.

  "text": "Trevello Travel Group Inc. Host Reviews\nI’ve been with Trevello, formerly Travel Professionals International, for 13 years now, and I can honestly say it’s been such a rewarding experience! From day one, I’ve always felt supported, whether it’s with day-to-day questions, bigger challenges, or just knowing there’s always someone in my corner. Their leadership and head office team truly goes above and beyond to make sure advisors have the tools they need to succeed.\nThe education they provide is also top-notch, with a great mix of online learning and in-person events that keep us sharp and up to date on industry changes. I’ve learned so much through their training programs, supplier sessions, and conferences, and I always come away with new ideas and inspiration.\nAnother thing I really value is the community. The other advisors are so supportive and generous with their knowledge, it really feels like being part of a family. We cheer each other on, share advice, and celebrate successes together.\nIf you’re looking for a host agency that not only has your back but also helps you grow both personally and professionally, I couldn’t recommend Trevello more highly!"
